The 21-year-old looked at his family from the dock before he was taken down the steps at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Monday. All three charges relate to the same woman. The player was first held in January over allegations relating to a young woman after images and videos were posted online. He had been on bail since but was arrested in the Trafford area on Saturday for an alleged breach of conditions. Members of Greenwood's family sat in a full public gallery in the small courtroom, along with members of the press. Wearing a grey hooded Nike jumper and grey jogging bottoms and flanked by two dock officers, the footballer, of Bowdon, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address. The attempted rape is alleged to have taken place in October 2021. The controlling and coercive behaviour relates to a period between November 2018 and October this year, where he is alleged to have made threatening and derogatory comments towards the complainant, as well as accessing and monitoring her social media accounts. The charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is dated December 2021. Within hours of the allegations surfacing online at the beginning of the year, the forward - who has made one appearance for England - was suspended from playing or training with the Old Trafford club. Nike suspended and later terminated its sponsorship deal with Greenwood, while Electronic Arts confirmed his removal from active squads on its FIFA 22 game. Greenwood will appear before Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court on November 21. The defendant's legal team told reporters they would be submitting a further bail application.", "ref-watch-should-phil-fodens-goal-against-liverpool-have-counted-in-man-city-defeat-at-anfield": "Dermot Gallagher dissects the big flashpoints from the weekend's Premier League action, including whether Phil Foden's goal at Anfield was correctly ruled in Liverpool's 1-0 win over Manchester City. INCIDENT: Phil Foden's goal at Anfield was ruled out for a shirt pull on Fabinho by Erling Haaland in the build-up following the intervention of the VAR. VERDICT: Correct decision. DERMOT SAYS: They have seen a foul in the build-up, but I also think there's a foul on the goalkeeper, Alisson. So I think it's very hard if you watch [the shirt pull] it's very hard to be convinced that it's not a foul. Danny Mills: I think it is a foul, but does Pep Guardiola have a point because all those fouls were allowed to go throughout the game? Does a referee change their opinion on a foul or the severity because it's a goal because I think that's where we are all a bit confused. At the end of the game, the shirt pull on Mo Salah is a lot worse of a shirt pull than that, but it isn't given. Is it only because it's a goal is scored that they look at it with more scrutiny? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  DERMOT SAYS: It's not more scrutiny, it's the fact that a goal was scored. With the Salah one that led to the red card for Jurgen Klopp, I think it's a foul and I think the assistant should flag that. It's not given but because it doesn't lead to a goal or a penalty or a red card on the pitch, it is not checked. That one did lead to a goal so it was checked. When you do look at it, it's hard to say it's not a foul and if they had checked further on I think they would give a foul on the goalkeeper as well. I was not surprised it was disallowed as well. INCIDENT: Klopp was sent off for his angry protestations over a foul on Salah that wasn't given. \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             \n              Live football on Sky Sports this week\n             \n              Get NOW to stream big moments\n             VERDICT: It was a foul, but Klopp deserved to be sent off. DERMOT SAYS: I thought it was a foul and easier to give a foul than not a foul. You see his reaction, he's very angry over it and reacts out of order. The fourth official calls the referee over and he gets a red card for his behaviour on the touchline. That's a direct result of that foul not being given, he's berating the official because he feels the foul should have been given. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  INCIDENT: Patrick Bamford's goal was ruled out for Leeds after a push on Gabriel in the penalty area. VERDICT: It was a foul. DERMOT SAYS: I thought it was a foul. When you see it, it's hard to say it's not a foul. The interesting thing is Bamford has pointed to his chest there, as if to say it isn't a handball. But you can see quite clearly he pushes him in the back. INCIDENT: VAR intervenes to award Leeds a penalty for a handball by Arsenal defender William Saliba - but Rasmus Kristensen was in an offside position in the build-up. VERDICT: It was a penalty. DERMOT SAYS: I think it's handball. Not given on the field, given by VAR - if it wasn't in use then it wouldn't have been given and the referee's decision would have been to play on. You can see that it not only hits his arm, but he moves toward the ball, so penalty for me. Rasmus Kristensen was offside, there's no doubt about that I just think it goes on too long, the ball goes back and gets recycled. They talk about second phases and resetting, I just think it takes too long so they don't want to go back that far. It didn't lead directly to the goal - it leads to the goal ultimately - but there has to be a point where you say they have reset. INCIDENT: VAR overturned the decision to send off Gabriel and award Leeds a penalty after the Arsenal defender was sent off for kicking out at Patrick Bamford after being shoved by the Leeds striker. VERDICT: Right decision by VAR. DERMOT SAYS: I think this is a really interesting incident because the referee doesn't give anything. He goes across to the assistant, and he says he thinks Gabriel has kicked out violently, so it has to be a penalty because the ball was in play. So he's given a penalty and a red card. You see quite clearly that Patrick Bamford has committed a foul and then the kick is petulant, it's unsporting, but it's not violent. So when he goes to the TV monitor VAR tells him to have another look and ultimately the right decision is made. There's no doubt Gabriel has flicked out, I think it's petulant, reckless at worst but it's not violent for me. It would be very unfair for a centre-half to be serving a three-match ban for what wasn't an act of violent conduct.

The referee Craig Pawson said the free-kick had not yet been taken and the goal was disallowed. VERDICT: Correct decision, the referee has blown for offside and the free-kick had not been taken. DERMOT SAYS: The referee has given offside, that is why they are waiting. But Schar has rolled the ball back to Pope to take the free-kick from where he is and that is what the referee is saying to the Man Utd players. I think the fact the play was so delayed before Ronaldo nipped in to take the ball tells you everything. The referee's arm is up all the way which is indicating that he is waiting for that free-kick to be taken. I think you would have more of an argument if that was given as a goal. INCIDENT: Raphael Varane avoided giving away a penalty for a challenge on Callum Wilson. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  VERDICT: It was a foul, but it is an on-field penalty. DERMOT SAYS: I don't think the referee thinks this is a foul and he thinks they come together. If he gives a foul, this won't be overturned by the VAR. I think this is all about the referee on the day. If the referee gives a penalty the ref will stick with him. Some decisions fall into the 'It must be an on-field decision' category. I do think it's a foul, but the problem is that it's an on-field penalty. Don't forget the tolerance for VAR isn't the same tolerance level on the referee. Danny Mills: I think the Callum Wilson one was the most blatant penalty I've ever seen. I don't understand how you are watching that and don't see that as a foul. If you're looking back and saying that the tiny little tug on Fabinho by Haaland is a foul - he steps across him, doesn't play the ball and is miles away from the ball. There is no other decision other than foul. VAR must have looked at that incident, so I would love to know why the VAR official looks at that and says that is not a foul. DERMOT SAYS: I'm of the belief that the referee has said to him that he thinks Varane has come across and they've collided. So he's fed that back to the VAR - he has a look and goes with that because for the VAR to intervene he has to be convinced that the referee has made a clear an obvious error. Danny Mills: I don't think you get more clear and obvious than that. Sue Smith: I agree, I am 100 per cent with you. I thought it was a penalty, the way Varane lunges across I was so surprised that VAR didn't tell the referee to have another look at that. INCIDENT: Kieran Trippier avoids giving away a penalty for a challenge on Ronaldo in which he does not get the ball. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  VERDICT: Not a penalty. DERMOT SAYS: I didn't think it was a penalty. Ronaldo comes across to Trippier and they collide there is no doubt about that, but he comes into Trippier as much as he comes into him. I can understand he is trying to protect the ball, but for me it's not a penalty. Sue Smith: I thought that was a penalty, you can see from Trippier's reaction that he feels he may have done something there. So I thought they each should have had a penalty in this game. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Danny Mills: If you make a challenge in the box, don't get the ball, make contact and stop Ronaldo doing what he wants to do again I don't see why it's not a penalty. INCIDENT: Sean Longstaff avoids giving away a penalty for a challenge on Jadon Sancho despite not making contact with the ball. VERDICT: It should have been a penalty. DERMOT SAYS: I think this is a penalty, when you see this Longstaff takes his foot. I was surprised this wasn't given. I can't see how this wasn't given. The referee has the perfect view and he said no. Sue Smith: I think this was a penalty. Clearly doesn't get anything of the ball. Danny Mills: It's a poor decision. It should be a penalty, I think with the on-field decision Sancho's reaction doesn't help him because he jumps too high and tries to make it too obvious. But that is why VAR is there, the reaction should be irrelevant. It should be a penalty. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  INCIDENT: Harry Kane wins a penalty after being brought down by Jordan Pickford. VERDICT: Hard not to give a penalty. DERMOT SAYS: I can understand why a penalty is given. The goalkeeper loses the ball and is down in desperation and tries to get the ball and Kane goes over him. Many people have said Kane is instigating the contact, but Pickford has put himself in that position. Another Saturday, another £250,000 up for grabs with Super 6.

Rangers once again lacked conviction at Fir Park on Sunday, but beat Motherwell 2-1 to recover from their 7-1 hammering by Liverpool in the Champions League. They have not lost a league match since Celtic beat them 4-0 on September 3 and remain two points behind their Old Firm rivals in the title race. Miller believes that result and their four defeats in Europe are to blame for current performances. \"When Gio first came in, you did see a clear identity and little subtle changes to the way that his 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 formation would play compared to Steven Gerrard's,\" he told Sky Sports News. \"I think what they're suffering from at the moment is a lot of heavy defeats in Europe, that Celtic game was also a heavy defeat and they just look like they're lacking a bit of confidence at the moment.

The winger, who has only ever played for the Hoops, reached 100 goals as he impressed after making a rare start. \"I don't think you can question too much of what Ange (Postecoglou)has done over his time at Celtic so far, but with James Forrest you forget how important how important he can be for Celtic and Scotland,\" said the former Celtic frontman. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"He's only 31 and when he played against Hibs he just showed what he can do. I think he fits really, really well with what Ange will want to play and you saw that on Saturday. \"He's a constant goal threat, he plays that position off the right really, really well as he has done for a number of years. \"He gets 100 goals for the club which is an incredible achievement. \"I think it could be really daunting if you had Jota on one side and James Forrest on the other side in full flow. \"So I think there was maybe a wee sign that maybe he does deserve a bit more time and maybe he'll get more time after his exploits of Saturday.

Did Liverpool stop Kevin De Bruyne at source, or were City one man short on the right flank?  Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher traded opposing views on Super Sunday - but who was right? Mohamed Salah's sensational second-half goal divided the sides at Anfield, but there was division in the studio after the full-time whistle as Carragher praised Liverpool for stifling Kevin De Bruyne - but Neville disagreed and blamed City's system. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Guardiola elected to start with three centre-backs for the first time in the Premier League this season - with De Bruyne stationed alongside Ilkay Gundogan behind Erling Haaland. \"The two times De Bruyne got time on the ball, he found Haaland in the first half,\" said Carragher. \"Haaland doesn't score and the other one was the disallowed goal - a brilliant pass. \"I think it's because Liverpool stopped City from having space and time on the ball, because if you get it there, De Bruyne always delivers.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The stats certainly back that up: Liverpool excelled across all key defensive metrics against the reigning champions and almost doubled their season average for tackles per game. In term of work-rate, Liverpool clocked 118.59 km - a distance only surpassed once by Klopp's side over the past three league campaigns. Liverpool were also noticeably deeper than usual. Both sides have traditionally led the way for playing high lines, but the Reds' average passing sequence started at just 34m from their own goal. \n              Latest Premier League table \n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             \n              Live football on Sky Sports this week\n             Liverpool ran 118.6km against Man City - only Tottenham have run further in a Premier League game this season, clocking 119.4km against Leicester in September To put that into context, that's 14m deeper than Liverpool's average against Crystal Palace in August. In fact, it's the deepest they have played in the Premier League since facing City nearly three years ago in 2019. However, Neville disagreed and suggested City's system isolated De Bruyne: \"I'm not sure about [Carragher's point]. \"Look, who are we to sit here and criticise Pep Guardiola? [But] the space for De Bruyne is always created when Cancelo [is slightly behind him and wide] and another player [is out wide, in front of Cancelo]. Then the ball goes [to the advanced wide player] and De Bruyne makes that run. \"De Bruyne had no player outside on that final line. Cancelo is playing like a right wing-back, which meant he was a pass short as well - so they had an option short on that side. City always have a triangle on each side, which means these [free the channel] for De Bruyne's runs. \"City played with a back five in possession, they had three at the back, two [wide] and the boxes in midfield - where De Bruyne was the man inside - but he didn't have the Liverpool full-back being pulled out.\" Carragher: \"They didn't play with a back five with the ball, they didn't!! They had a back three, Cancelo was right-wing, Foden out on left. A box midfield and three up front.\" Neville: \"That wasn't how it was. Who was on the right wing?\" Carragher: \"Cancelo.\" Neville: \"No chance! He was deeper than a right winger ordinarily would be, miles deeper. We'll have to watch it back.\" Carragher: \"What are you doing tomorrow?\" Neville: \"I will watch it back!\" Neville proceeded to clarify his point of view: \"Cancelo would ordinarily be [slightly behind De Bruyne and wide] and Mahrez, or Foden, would be [out wide in front of Cancelo]. \"They only had De Bruyne and Cancelo on that [right] side. Two players versus normally having three. That is indisputable, wherever you think Cancelo played. They had a man short on that side, which, I think, left De Bruyne slightly isolated in that channel. \"It meant (Andy) Robertson could play narrower, because the wide player got back in. I think it cost City, in terms of De Bruyne. Getting the space he ordinarily would.\" As the graphic below shows, City were certainly light on passing combinations down the right channel, with Cancelo and De Bruyne completely isolated as the only City players occupying that flank in the opposition half. Indeed, it appeared to be a tactical ploy to target Liverpool's right channel, where James Milner tussled with Phil Foden and came out on top. In summary, the stats provide supporting evidence for both pundits' opinions, with Liverpool excelling defensively, Cancelo playing slightly deeper than a regular right winger at City and De Bruyne being slightly isolated down a barren right flank.

The 26-year-old is the biggest riser this week as England boss Gareth Southgate prepares to name his preliminary squad for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, his announcement expected on Thursday, but Reece James has slid in the opposite direction after picking up an ill-timed knee injury. James Maddison endured a poor audition in front of Southgate but others impressed, including Liverpool's Joe Gomez, man of the match against Manchester City, and goalkeepers Nick Pope and Aaron Ramsdale. Join us as we run through the players on the plane, those sitting in the departure lounge with their boarding passes in hand, and those stuck in traffic in a taxi on their way to the airport. The notable absentee from the first section of the ladder this week is Reece James, whose knee injury is set to keep him out for eight weeks, making him a major doubt for the World Cup and sending him tumbling down our rankings. The Chelsea defender has dropped a whopping 30 places to 37th. Having previously been on the plane to Qatar, and, in all probability, in Southgate's starting line-up at the tournament, he is now facing a race against time to prove his fitness. \n              Last week's England ladder rankings\n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             \n              Live football on Sky Sports\n             His prospects do not look good given he is expected to be wearing a knee brace for up to a month but others are looking in stronger positions in this section of the ladder following the latest round of games. Harry Kane remains top having scored his ninth Premier League goal of the season from the penalty spot in Tottenham's win over Everton, while Mason Mount (6th) has jumped three places following his two-goal performance for Chelsea against Aston Villa. Arsenal's Bukayo Saka (7th) is also on the rise, his winning goals against Bodo/Glimt and Leeds seeing him jump above Raheem Sterling (8th), while goalkeepers Nick Pope (11th) and Aaron Ramsdale (12th) have climbed six places apiece following impressive displays for Newcastle and Arsenal respectively, putting them on the plane as Jordan Pickford's (3rd) back-ups. Kieran Trippier (10th) is the other big mover in this section, moving up four places partly because of his impressive form for Newcastle, but also due to England's mounting injury problems at right-back. Welcome to the departure lounge, Ivan Toney (24th)! The Brentford striker has climbed nine places following his man-of-the-match display against Brighton on Friday, with Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher saying he \"has to go\" to the World Cup. Toney scored the first of his two goals with an outstanding flicked finish, but it was his second, netted from the penalty spot, which best underlined what makes him so enticing to Southgate. Indeed, in addition to all he offers in general play (Toney is now on eight Premier League goals for the season), he has an incredible penalty record, converting 20 out of 20 attempts for the Bees. His spot kick prowess, and unique technique, could be crucial for England, especially when you consider the Three Lions have contested shootouts in three of the last four major tournaments in which they have reached the knockout stages. Toney's form places him above Marcus Rashford (25th), whose form continues to fluctuate after a series of wasted chances in Manchester United's most recent games against Omonia Nicosia and Newcastle. Chelsea's Conor Gallagher (21st) looks to be in an increasingly strong position while Arsenal's Ben White (22nd) continues to rise too, his fine form for the Premier League leaders surely making him unignorable to Southgate, especially given the injuries he has elsewhere, not to mention White's versatility. Has James Maddison (33rd) played his way out of contention? The Leicester midfielder has shone in difficult circumstances for Brendan Rodgers' side this season, climbing to 29th in the ladder last week, but a poor showing in front of the watching Southgate in Saturday's goalless draw with Crystal Palace has set him back. Maddison's determination to catch Southgate's eye was obvious but he ended up missing several scoring chances at the King Power Stadium, then got booked for diving in the closing stages when attempting to win a penalty, meaning he faces suspension from Leicester's next game. It felt like Maddison might need to do something special to win over Southgate given his solitary cap for England came way back in 2019, although his team-mate Harvey Barnes (32nd), whose only cap came more recently, had a better game. This final section of the graphic features the injured Kyle Walker (30th), as well James, but could that duo's fitness problems present a route back into the frame for Trent Alexander-Arnold (35th) and Joe Gomez (36th)? Gomez returns to the ladder having dropped out last week, the 25-year-old, who has 11 England caps, providing an outstanding assist from right-back during Liverpool's 7-1 win over Rangers, then winning the man-of-the-match award at centre-back in Sunday's thrilling 1-0 win over Manchester City. That performance at Anfield, against the free-scoring Erling Haaland, was a reminder of his considerable quality after what's been a difficult period for him, while the game also featured an earlier-than-expected return from injury for Alexander-Arnold, who came on as a late substitute. Southgate has been reluctant to trust Alexander-Arnold recently, while he has overlooked Gomez altogether, but injuries in his defensive line may lead to a re-think.

Salah's strike was enough for Jurgen Klopp's side to end City's unbeaten start to the campaign and close the gap between the sides to 10 points.

He said: \"It was the same when I was at United, the feeling coming into this game. Sir Alex [Ferguson] was always different. The boss all week would be more serious and would get that look in his eyes that was different. \"Then you'd come here and there was very little talking in the changing room before a day like today. \"Even when you're a really good side, you walk out and 'You'll Never Walk Alone' hits you and you feel like you're into something that's different from most grounds, not just here, but in Europe. \"Coming here, Pep Guardiola knows this is as tough as it gets. I was down on the touchline half an hour before kick-off and he'd been sat in the dugout for half an hour. You do things here that you don't do elsewhere - you don't usually see him do that at away grounds.

City recognise that this place is difficult.\" Neville added that City's defeat was good news for the Premier League and the prospect of a title race developing this season, given Arsenal are now four points clear at the top of the table. \"For the league, if you're Arsenal today or someone else, you recognise that this is an important moment,\" said Neville. \"We probably think this [Liverpool] is one of the only teams that can beat Man City and now they've done it, it means the league is more competitive, which is what we want. \"I had that feeling coming into the game and over the last few weeks that maybe earlier in season, City could win the league by 15 or 20 points - and they still could. But the longer it goes on, the longer it's competitive. \"We don't want that situation whereby our league is won with 10 or five games to go. We've been lucky in the last few years that Liverpool have pushed them close and it remains to be seen whether others can do that.\" Download the Gary Neville Podcast for free below.

The only goal of the game came with just over an hour on the clock and through an unlikely source. Tessel Middag got only her second goal of the SWPL season from a free-kick, smashing the ball into the top corner from just outside the box. The result means the reigning champions go back to top of the table on goal difference, one ahead of Celtic, while Hibernian are on just seven points from seven games. Celtic recorded an emphatic win over bottom of the table Glasgow Women, although it took the hosts until the 38th minute to break the deadlock. Lucy Ashford-Clifford scored directly from a free-kick near the corner flag before doubling Celtic's lead just four minutes later, scoring again from a free-kick. Taylor Otto made it three just after the restart and Caitlin Hayes added another, heading in with just under an hour on the clock.

She converted the penalty as Priscilla Chinchilla had her shirt pulled in the box. Davidson then doubled her tally for the day, again from a penalty with 21 minutes gone. Chinchilla got her third goal of the SWPL campaign with five minutes left in the half and turned provider to Kinga Kozak just moments into the second half, with the Polish international firing into the top corner from inside the box. With just under an hour played, Davidson completed her hat-trick of penalties before Abbi Grant rounded off the game with a late finish to claim her 50th SWPL goal.

But it was Mohamed Salah, not Erling Haaland, who proved the decisive figure at Anfield on Sunday. Salah had flickered into life with his six-minute hat-trick against Rangers following a period of poor form and he picked up where he left off against Manchester City. \"Electric,\" was Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher's assessment of his performance. The winning goal showed him at his devastating best, the 30-year-old cushioning Alisson's long kick and spinning away from City defender Joao Cancelo in one sweeping movement before keeping his cool to beat the advancing Ederson. But it was not the first time Salah had engineered a route in behind City's defence, the visitors requiring an outstanding save from Ederson to prevent him from scoring in similar circumstances soon after the interval. Haaland, meanwhile, floundered at the other end, Liverpool becoming only the second Premier League side all season to prevent him from scoring - and the first to keep a clean sheet against City. It seemed everyone inside Anfield was waiting for the net to bulge when he met Kevin De Bruyne's diagonal cross at the far post in the first half, but his header went straight into the arms of Alisson. \n              Latest Premier League table \n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             \n              Premier League fixtures\n             He was denied by the Brazilian on other occasions too, once attempting to lift the ball over him following a trademark run off the shoulder of the last man, then seeing a low strike acrobatically pushed around the post in the second half. It was not Haaland's day in the end - albeit only by the ludicrous standards he has set himself - and his misfortune was compounded by the foul on Fabinho which prompted VAR to acrimoniously rule out Phil Foden's goal early in the second period. The pre-match discussion had focused on how quite how Liverpool would stop Haaland.

The 32-year-old put in a captain's display for Newcastle in their goalless draw at Manchester United as he showed his ability at both ends of the pitch. Defensively he was rock solid, winning possession eight times and making three interceptions - the joint-most for Newcastle in the game. There was one particular outstanding piece of defending against Cristiano Ronaldo in the second half as he got back superbly to make a well-timed last-ditch tackle to deny the Portugal forward from getting a shot away. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Then there was Trippier's influence offensively for Newcastle. Their best moment came through the right-back who delivered a fine side-volleyed cross with his weaker foot for Joelinton, who headed against the woodwork twice from it. The statistics again backed up his effectiveness going forward as he created the most chances (4) and recorded the most final third entries (13) in the game. Trippier was England's starting right wing-back in their World Cup semi-final run in Russia 2018 and four years on he could well be starting once again for Southgate in Qatar if he continues with top-notch performances such as these.Declan Olley Marcus Rashford looked to the sky before departing down the Old Trafford tunnel, no doubt mulling over what might have been. Having failed to score from 10 shots against Omonia Nicosia, Erik ten Hag opted to demote the forward to the Manchester United bench for the visit of Newcastle. Keeping this squad happy will be a constant battle for the Dutchman but winning matches is all that matters. Cristiano Ronaldo shook his head as Rashford replaced him on 71 minutes, a contrast in emotions from when he marked his second coming scoring twice in the corresponding fixture last season. It was over to Rashford to dig United out of a difficult spot, and he was involved in his side's two best opportunities to turn one point into three when after setting up Fred for a glaring miss six yards out, Rashford placed his header in the exact same spot, a yard wide of Nick Pope's left-hand post. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  While this draw was another building block in Newcastle's progression, it halts Manchester United in their tracks after a recent autumn resurgence. Having scored with their 34th shot in the Europa League on Thursday, only two of United's 15 attempts here were on target. It says a lot about their current striker situation that fans are pining for Anthony Martial, absent again here through injury, when the Frenchman has one Premier League start in the past 12 months. For sure, the dreadful Manchester derby defeat demonstrated that Ten Hag has his work cut out to orchestrate a title challenge - but Rashford and the rest of the profligate United attack must rediscover their rhythm if they are to land a statement win over Tottenham in midweek.Ben Grounds They say the sign of champions is winning ugly. And Arsenal have managed two of those victories in a week. First, they edge past Bodo/Glimt 1-0 in northern Norway with Bukayo Saka's winner coming off his lips. Now they've beaten Leeds with Saka netting the winner again with a goal, penalty and red card for the opposition all chalked off by VAR. Add a fortunate, soft penalty for their winner against Liverpool last week and some will say Arsenal are lucky. But when does luck stop becoming coincidence? The Gunners are where they are - with a four-point buffer at the top of the Premier League table - due to their resilience - the word Mikel Arteta keeps repeating this season. That resilience runs through the team: the redemption of Granit Xhaka after being stripped of the captaincy, Gabriel looking confident respite recent defensive mistakes against Fulham and Tottenham, Bukayo Saka bouncing back with big moments after his Euro 2020 heartache, Aaron Ramsdale stepping up after back-to-back relegations. A few years ago, Arsenal will have lost all three of these games they've won in the last seven days. Before they lacked backbone, wilted under pressure and couldn't respond to being pegged back. Now they're the ones to catch. So how far will this 'luck' take them?Sam Blitz After 10 games, the Premier League tends to divide up into its respective parts: title race, top-four battlers, mid-table side and relegation candidates. Unfortunately for Leeds, they're back in the bottom drawer. On the outset, it looks bleak. No wins in six league games, a lack of a reliable goalscorer to get them out of trouble in sight and now one point above the drop zone. The last time they went this long without a win, Marcelo Bielsa was sacked. But Leeds have all the ingredients to get them out of this predicament. Exciting players, attacking football, a fervent home and away support and a manager who embodies a fighting spirit at the club. But the small moments are letting them down. Moments like Rodrigo playing a erroneous and unnecessary cross-field ball in the run-up to Saka's winner, which Jesse Marsch says is \"not what we like to do.\" \"We were better on the day but we're walking away with nothing,\" said Marsch after his side's defeat on Sunday. \"The first half of the Palace game was outstanding, we should be 3-0 up in that match. We should have been it in this game. \"We're not capitalising and it puts stress on the environment. I have to stay calm and patient and I hate being patient. I think detest is a better word.

From an impressive win over Chelsea at the end of August to four defeats in a row, Ralph Hasenhuttl's side are probably the most up-and-down team in the Premier League. Defeat against Manchester City last weekend was expected, but losses to Everton, Aston Villa and Wolves before that saw the Saints drop into the relegation zone ahead of Sunday's Premier League fixtures. They welcomed West Ham to the south coast having lost 11 of their previous 15 matches in the league. The Hammers had won their past four in all competitions. Form might not have been on Southampton's side but it is always foolish to write them off. It is even more foolish to write off Ralph Hasenhuttl. They may have been clinging on to a point against the Hammers in the end, but the Saints delivered a first-half performance their manager can be proud of. Only one of their seven shots on target during the opening 45 minutes beat Fabianski, but the hosts showed they have the ability and desire to turn their fortunes around. However, how much more time the Austrian is given to inspire a revival remains to be seen. There were further boos from some of the home supporters at the final whistle, but he will take some comfort in knowing he has survived worse moments since taking charge in 2018. Two 9-0 defeats spring to mind.Dan Sansom It might seem strange to praise a forward who went close to scoring on at least four occasions but finished the game without a goal. However, it is worth mentioning the impact Gianluca Scamacca has made on West Ham in recent weeks. It is no coincidence their season has got back on track just as the striker is finding his feet at his new club. Goals in recent wins over Wolves and Fulham in the Premier League highlighted why West Ham invested £35.5m to sign the 23-year-old in the summer. Despite failing to find the back of the net at St Mary's, he showed again what an asset he can be for David Moyes. He was a constant thorn in Southampton's side and had the football gods been with him on Sunday, he could have easily scored a hat-trick. Scamacca's performances have helped West Ham move away from the relegation zone and he will be confident this is just the start of a successful career in the Premier League.

A packed Old Trafford witnessed a tense Premier League clash on Sunday afternoon, which started with Callum Wilson seeing a penalty appeal ignored. Joelinton twice hit the woodwork during an impressive first half from Newcastle, but the hosts bounced back after the break and Cristiano Ronaldo quickly saw two goals ruled out. There was no argument about the first decision but the Portugal forward was enraged by the second as he claimed Fabian Schar had taken the free-kick, meaning he was free to nip in to score before Nick Pope could react.

We had the chances with Rashford - the assist for Fred and header from a great, great cross from Casemiro. \"OK, that happens, in football, so happy with the performance but disappointed with the result.\" Ronaldo looked disappointed to be taken off as United chased a winner - shaking his head and muttering to himself as he walked off - and was the only change made by Ten Hag on Sunday. \"We have to cover four games in 10 days - and especially for the strikers I want to keep them fresh,\" he said. \"I want to keep them all fresh, so we have to rotate there. We have some problems. (Anthony) Martial is not available in this moment so we have a player less. \"Then Rashy was under the weather, so he did not have energy for the whole game so we have to plan to cover for the four games because we want to win all the four games or at least get a result in all four games.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Newcastle boss Eddie Howe was pleased with his side's display at Old Trafford and felt they had a \"very strong\" penalty shout for Raphael Varane's early challenge on Wilson.

But the thinking behind sacrificing a forward for a defensive midfielder, at a time when Spurs were chasing an opening goal at an anxious Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, soon became clear. After a ragged first half in which the hosts had struggled to create clear openings and an obstinate Everton side had sliced them apart twice on the break, only to spurn both chances, Bissouma's presence at the base of midfield instantly gave more control. The 26-year-old found a Spurs team-mate with every one of his 28 passes, finishing the game with a 100 per cent success rate and allowing the hosts to pin the visitors back, Everton unable to even muster a shot on goal in the second period. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There were important defensive interventions from him too, not least the headed interception, when Everton might previously have got through, which allowed Spurs to launch the attack which led to their second goal following Harry Kane's penalty. The identities of the two men who combined for that second goal, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentancur, the pair previously operating as a midfield two, neatly highlighted another benefit of Bissouma's introduction. Suddenly, they were freed up to get further forward, and Everton, having previously outnumbered Spurs in the centre of the pitch with their trio of Idrissa Gueye, Amadou Onana and Alex Iwobi, found themselves losing the upper hand. \n              Tottenham fixtures\n             \n              Premier League table \n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             Bissouma's presence impacted Heung-Min Son positively too. The South Korea forward had endured a largely frustrating evening until that point, stationed out wide on the left, often ceding the space inside him to under-lapping wing-back Ivan Perisic. But with Richarlison withdrawn for Bissouma and Conte's system adjusted accordingly, Son was able to operate centrally, in closer proximity to Kane, with the wing-backs focusing solely on the flanks. There was no goal for him on the night, of course, Son ultimately unable to add to his tally following his double against Eintracht Frankfurt in midweek, but he clearly relished that change. Within a few minutes of Bissouma's introduction, Son was in the right place for a headed chance in the middle of the box. There was another effort, from a similarly dangerous position, which he sent over. Suddenly, he was popping up in areas where he could hurt Everton having previously been kept at arm's length. This was one of only a handful of occasions when Spurs have used a midfield three instead of a two so far this season, but it surely shows the way forward - especially with Richarlison now injured and Dejan Kulusevski still recovering from his hamstring injury. After all, the other occasions have ended similarly successfully. Last weekend, there was the hard-fought 1-0 win over Brighton, only Bissouma's second Premier League start for Spurs following his arrival from the Seagulls in the summer. Before that, back in September, there was the second half of the Leicester game, which Spurs ended up winning 6-2 with the help of three unanswered goals following Bissouma's introduction. Hojbjerg, one of the players most directly affected by the change of system, certainly sees the benefits. \"When you play with the extra man in midfield you can find your position and be a bit more patient and overload in certain areas,\" he told Sky Sports after the game on Saturday evening. \"It also helps us maintain the ball, which is something we need to do better, especially when you are playing every three days. Playing with three in middle is something we have to do and we did it today.\" \"The manager deserves credit,\" added Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp. \"He made a good substitution at a time when the game was going nowhere - it looked to be petering out. \"He could have brought on Bryan Gil or Lucas Moura when he lost Richarlison but he decided to thicken up the midfield and push the wing-backs up. \"It was hard for them in the first half as they were getting outnumbered in midfield. If you get more bodies in there you can control the game.\" It remains to be seen how Conte will feel about using a three when Kulusevski returns. The Sweden international's form since his arrival from Juventus - he has scored six goals and provided 11 assists in 25 Premier League games - has made him practically undroppable in the eyes of many fans. But even in many of the games Spurs have won with Kulusevski in the team this season, control and consistency in midfield have been lacking. They are qualities Bissouma, as a part of a three rather than a two, appears to give them. \"Bissouma played a really good game, his impact was really, really positive,\" said Conte, before praising the Mali international for how he has adapted to life at Spurs following a difficult start. \"I think he is understanding now that he is in a top club and the pressure is different, the level of intensity of the training sessions is higher. Concentration has to be there at every moment. He is understanding this now. We are talking about a really good player.\" Conte went on to explain Lucas Moura's lack of match fitness and Gil's inexperience were other factors in the decision to opt for Bissouma, but the conclusion, after a victory which made this Tottenham's best ever start to a Premier League season, was clear. \"In the end, after a win, I think my decision was good.\" Another Saturday, another £250,000 up for grabs with Super 6.

Now we have to support him.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The World Cup begins on November 20, with England beginning their group campaign a day later against Iran. England manager Gareth Southgate has seen three of his leading right-backs succumb to injury in recent weeks. Manchester City's Kyle Walker is a major doubt to make Southgate's squad following a groin surgery, with his inclusion resting on his recovery, while Liverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold is also sidelined. Alexander-Arnold was ruled out for a fortnight after sustaining an ankle injury in Liverpool's 3-2 defeat at Arsenal last Sunday. By far and away the prime standby candidate to come into the England fold in the event of a right-back crisis is Ben White, who is excelling on the right of league leaders Arsenal's defence. White's versatility makes him a classic 'Southgate player' when it comes to England - the manager has regularly picked and favoured players who can adopt multiple positions such as Walker, Trippier, Bukayo Saka and Raheem Sterling. The Arsenal defender is naturally a centre-back but has been starring for the Gunners at right-back this term - while he can also feature at right centre-back in a three and - if needed - central midfield. White's tactical game is diverse too. He started the season by adopting infield positions at right-back - but showed in recent matches against Tottenham and Liverpool that he can bomb forward around the outside of his right winger, this being England international Saka at Arsenal. A part of the Euro 2020 squad two summers ago, White has some experience of being in a tournament football environment and - considering his last two England caps came in a right-back role - Southgate is facing real questions as to why the Arsenal defender is not in this autumn picture already. Only two other right-backs have been selected by Southgate in the last 12 months - Southampton's Kyle Walker-Peters and Leicester full-back James Justin. It's harder to compare the attacking qualities of full-backs from clubs currently battling at the wrong end of the table, but Justin certainly stands out at his club this term. Formidable in the air, the 24-year-old has covered down both flanks and registered team-topping numbers for winning duels and blocking crosses. But Justin also excels on the ball with only Harvey Barnes taking more touches on the ball or attempting more dribbles this season. The only issue for Justin is that he is too similar in profile to Trippier in the way he can adopt both flanks - and with plenty of competition on those two areas, the 24-year-old seems too far down the queue for a realistic call-up. As is the case with Justin, Walker-Peters' statistics are harder to contextualise with Southampton currently sat 17th in the table. The radar below reveals an all-round effectiveness to his game, notably for attempting dribbles and crosses. Based on historical returns, his high reading for goalscoring is arguably skewed due to the limited number of games so far - currently boosted by his solitary goal against Leeds in August. However, the 25-year-old has proven his defensive attributes over the years and his above-average returns for winning duels exemplifies this best.

Unfortunately for Maddison, Southgate is likely to have left the King Power Stadium feeling he has made the correct decision to leave the midfielder out of his squad, where he has been ever since earning his only cap three years ago.

Maddison also saw Leicester's best chance of the game fall his way when Harvey Barnes pulled the ball back to him when he was unmarked in the Palace area but, perhaps aware of the eyes watching him from the executive seats, he snatched at his chance, blazing it over the bar.

Of course he did. It's 258 in total for the 29-year-old now, including nine in 10 games in the Premier League this season. Throw in his first-half penalty in Wednesday's Champions League meeting with Eintracht Frankfurt and it's 10 in all competitions. He has reached double figures in just 14 games. It took him 23 to reach that milestone last term. Everything points to Kane being in the form of his life and yet it is hardly being talked about, with Erling Haaland's extraordinary start to life at Manchester City, for whom he has already hit the 20-mark, ensuring he is dominating the discourse around strikers. It would be foolish, though, however freakish a talent Haaland might be, to take what Kane is doing for granted, or underestimate just how well he is performing for Antonio Conte's side right now. Against Everton, he was at times unplayable, attempting seven shots, four of which hit the target, having 13 touches in the opposition box - more than the entire Everton team combined - and also creating three scoring opportunities for his team-mates. His second-half performance was just the latest reminder that he does it all for this Spurs side, scoring and creating; holding the ball up - as he did for their second goal - and laying it off; leading from the front and even helping to protect his own box. There was no mention of him in Conte's post-match press conference, the limelight instead taken by players who do not do it so consistently it has become routine. But Kane, even by his standards, looks to be at the very peak of his powers.Nick Wright The difference between Everton's last two trips to Tottenham is night and day. They were thumped 5-0 back in March but on Saturday they left the Spurs stadium kicking themselves for not landing a draw or even win. Ultimately, though, as Frank Lampard pointed out afterwards, they got the same number of points for both performances. Progress is being made, that is evident. But Everton's finishing is stalling the rate of that improvement. Against Spurs, Demarai Gray and Amadou Onana missed golden one-on-one opportunities, blazing over when they were clean through. Had they scored, it would have looked like the perfect away day performance, with Everton - who boasted the joint-best defensive record in the league before kick-off - limiting Spurs to just a handful of half-chances in the opening 45 minutes. It would have set up a very different second half. But only three teams have scored fewer than Everton's total of eight from their first 10 games. They are bottom three for big chance conversion rates and fifth-worst in the league for shot conversion. Experience? Confidence in front of goal? Lampard offered up a couple of possible explanations for the misses on Saturday. But it is a problem he needs to solve if he is to continue to lift this Everton team up the table.Peter Smith Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Managerless Wolves moved out of the relegation zone as a result of Saturday's slender victory over fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest. Their troublesome plight, however, will only be temporarily apprehended by the narrow success - which was tinged with an element of good fortune. At surface value, three points are of course welcome. But they hide a myriad of problems. At no point can Wolves claim to have been convincing winners. Had it not have been for some Jose Sa heroics to thwart Brennan Johnson's late penalty, a 1-1 scoreline would have been the likely outcome. It's the second time the Portuguese goalkeeper has salvaged points via a penalty stop this season - saving Aleksandar Mitrovic's effort back in August. Wolves are living precariously. It is telling that Nuno Espirito Santo has been in talks over a remarkable return to the club 17 months after his departure - they have been in decline ever since. They may have dominated possession and territory against Forest but a lack of goals from open play is concerning. Entries are abundant, end product less so. They ended a run of 370 minutes without a Premier League goal following Ruben Neves' second-half spot-kick, which VAR awarded. In fact, VAR reviews were responsible for most of the game's suspense and entertainment value. The football, conversely, was less forthcoming. A slog wrapped up in a rare win.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"It's about continuing the process of trying to find the best team, find the best way of playing,\" Nottingham Forest head coach Steve Cooper said after their 1-0 loss at Wolves. \"We know we're going through that phase of trying to become who we want to be, so we have to continue with that.\" But, with nearly a third of the Premier League season gone, time is now becoming Cooper's enemy in his \"process\". Their 10th league game of the season saw them lose for the seventh time to leave them bottom, four points adrift from safety, with their only win coming in mid-August. The defeat at Molineux was even more alarming considering it was against fellow strugglers Wolves, who won for just the second time this season. It is yet another game Forest have lost when they needed to take points, having suffered home defeats against fellow promoted sides Bournemouth and Fulham as well as a heavy loss at relegation-threatened Leicester. Now the fixture list takes a turn for the worse for Cooper's side as they face Brighton away on Tuesday followed by Liverpool at home on Saturday and then Arsenal away - it is hard to see them taking a point from any of those games. The stats are damning too about Forest's performances: they have lost all five games this season when conceding first, while they have conceded 23 goals in their first 10 top-flight games in a season for only the second time in their history. It is no wonder that following the defeat at Wolves Forest have become heavy favourites with the bookmakers to be relegated this season.Declan Olley Wilfried Zaha, Odsonne Edouard, Jordan Ayew and Eberechi Eze started for Crystal Palace at Leicester. Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta came off the bench. Yet, despite fielding an attacking line-up many in the Premier League would covet, the Eagles registered just one shot on target - and never looked like scoring - in a forgettable stalemate at the King Power Stadium. \"We didn't create anything - nothing! We were not aggressive enough. We didn't penetrate enough. We lacked quality,\" was manager Patrick Vieira's assessment after a performance which put as much spotlight on him as it did his toothless attack. This was Vieira's sixth goalless draw in the Premier League since taking charge at Selhurst Park - since the start of last season, no side has played out more stalemates than Palace - and the 24th time the Eagles had failed to hit double figures for shots in a game during the same period. Vieira was keen to recognise a resolute defensive display which ultimately earned Palace a point, but with unwanted league highs in the worst possible metrics, is that enough to spare him from scrutiny?Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  What more can Gary O'Neil do to get the Bournemouth job on a permanent basis? Picking up this role on the back of a 9-0 drubbing by Liverpool might well have been one of the hardest in football. Bournemouth, after all, were supposed to be \"underequipped for this level\" in the words of former boss Scott Parker. Yet since then they have not lost - unbeaten in six matches - and are ninth, above Liverpool. Who would have predicted that a month ago? O'Neil has grown into the role. On the touchline at Craven Cottage he was a bundle of energy. Pointing, shouting, solving problems and encouraging his team. Bournemouth put together two wonderful moves for their first-half goals and despite coming under heavy pressure in the second half, only a debatable penalty decision separated them from a third win under O'Neil. If the 39-year-old is not chosen to lead Bournemouth's survival mission then he has given himself the best possible advert for his career in the dugout.David Richardson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Italian named an unchanged side for the third successive game at the start of his Seagulls tenure, but there was enough here to suggest that will now change. Brighton had the incentive of moving back into the top four with a victory in west London, but they headed into night ruing another profligate performance. Brentford just love it under the lights on a Friday. They are unbeaten in their last 10 league games played on this day, winning eight and drawing two, with the Bees winning each of the last six of these games.

It was a classy touch before a contest high on quality, 24 years on from this being an encounter played out in the English fourth tier. Frank said his players let their supporters down during last Saturday's 5-1 defeat at Newcastle - but this was the perfect response as Freed From Desire played out at a bouncing Gtech Community Stadium and the players took a lap of honour at the final whistle. After three games without a win, there was relief on Frank's face but there is an unshakable spirit and a connection here that will not be dampened by the occasional difficult moment. One win in six after demolishing Manchester United, but with centurion Ivan Toney still deadeye in front of goal, there was always too much ability for Brentford to be in the doldrums for too long.Ben Grounds Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Just three matches into his tenure as Brighton head coach, Roberto De Zerbi has discovered the issue that has plagued the Seagulls for years. Speaking to Sky Sports after seeing his side go down 2-0 at Brentford despite having more than 70 per cent of possession and recording three times as many shots as their opponents, the Italian declared: \"We shoot a lot but don't score.\" Brighton supporters may point out that they have been saying the same thing for the past four seasons, given the side has underperformed compared to its expected goals (xG) total in each of the past three seasons. Graham Potter appeared to have finally resolved those issues at the start of this season, with Brighton just about outperforming their xG during the six matches he oversaw before moving to Chelsea in September. Since then, Brighton have reverted to type. The south coast side may have notched three at Anfield in De Zerbi's thrilling first game in charge but they have failed to find the net since and again find their goals tally trailing their xG total. Fingers will inevitably be pointed at Danny Welbeck, who has led the line in every match this season and has an xG total of 2.2 but is yet to find the net. But Solly March must also share some of the blame. The wing-back has an xG total of 2.21 after also featuring in every game but he too has failed to score this season. In fact, the Brighton academy product has not scored in the Premier League since November 2020, despite attempting more than 50 shots in that time. De Zerbi has no need to panic, given Brighton are seventh - largely thanks to their results under Potter - and have a home game against 19th-placed Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, but the new boss may have to be patient when it comes to fixing a problem that took his predecessor three years to solve.Joe Shread Another Saturday, another £250,000 up for grabs with Super 6.

James was forced off during the second half of Chelsea's 2-0 win away to AC Milan in the Champions League, with claims emerging on Friday that the defender would be unable to take his place in the England squad for the tournament in Qatar, which kicks off on November 20. However, Potter put the brakes on those reports ahead of Chelsea's trip to Aston Villa on Sunday - live on Sky Sports - saying: \"He's due to see a specialist over the weekend so, until we get that information, there's not too much else I can add unfortunately. The rest would just be speculation from my perspective. \"We spoke yesterday (Thursday) and he felt not too bad but, until you get these things checked, you never know. \"There's no point looking into the doomsday scenario yet. We just need to check and then go forward.\" If James is forced to miss the World Cup, it will be a huge blow for Gareth Southgate, who has started the 22-year-old in England's last four matches.

Kante's setback is the latest injury blow for the 31-year-old, who has been unavailable since suffering a hamstring injury against Tottenham in August and has only started 54 per cent of Chelsea's Premier League matches since the start of the 2019/20 season due to a range of fitness issues. Former Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel said last season it was a \"miracle\" that his side were able to finish third after missing Kante for so much of the campaign and his successor Potter has been unable to call on the midfielder for any of his five matches in charge. Chelsea have a big decision to make over Kante's future given his contract expires at the end of the season and Potter conceded his regular absences are a \"concern\". \"Historically there's things that have happened that are a concern so we need to get to the bottom of that,\" said the head coach. \"It's a setback in the last stage of his rehab so that's worrying. All we can do is get the right diagnosis, get the right consultation and then try to help him get back to full fitness and enjoying his football.\" The clock is ticking as Gareth Southgate prepares to name his preliminary squad for Qatar 2022 on October 21 and our ladder, updated weekly and made up of the top 40 players in contention, ranks the latest risers and fallers.

It was a good window to be able to get in have the surgery and for us to get organised behind the scenes. \"I've spoken to her quite a few times over the last week, as you can imagine.

Dundee United appear to have kickstarted their season with back-to-back wins and they can move further away from bottom side Ross County with victory in Dingwall. Here we take a look at what is at stake this weekend... After their 7-1 humiliation against Liverpool in the Champions League, Rangers will look to restore some pride when they face Motherwell on Sunday, live on Sky Sports Football. The Ibrox side could go into the match at Fir Park five points behind Celtic if they beat Hibernian on Saturday.

They managed two draws at Ibrox last season, but lost both home games against Rangers. Will Celtic extend their lead against Hibs? Celtic will be looking to get back to winning ways after a tough night in the Champions League against RB Leipzig. With Rangers not in action until Sunday they can extend their advantage at the top if they beat a Hibs side who suffered their first defeat in five on Tuesday night. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Influential winger Jota has joined Celtic captain Callum McGregor on the sidelines with David Turnbull and Stephen Welsh also out, but Liel Abada has recovered after being forced off during their game against Leipzig. Hibs do not have a good record at Celtic Park and have not won there since 2010. Will Dundee United make it three in a row? It is a battle of the bottom two in Dingwall as Ross County host Dundee United. Liam Fox's side sent County down to 12th on goal difference when they made it back-to-back wins on Tuesday night, beating Hibs 1-0. They do appear to be hitting form after a tough start to the season, while Malky Mackay's men will also be feeling confident after recording their first win in six last weekend. Who will rediscover their winning form at the Tony Macaroni Arena? Livingston and St Johnstone both go into Saturday's match on the back of two consecutive defeats in the Scottish Premiership. David Martindale's side lost to bottom-of-the-table Ross County in their last match, but know victory at home this weekend could lift them into the top six in the Scottish Premiership. It was a heart-breaking injury-time loss to Celtic for Callum Davidson's men last weekend, live on Sky Sports, and he will be looking for them to find some points to avoid being dragged back into the danger zone. Will St Mirren continue to impress at home? St Mirren have the best home record in the league outside of Celtic and Rangers, winning four of their five home games so far this season. Victory against Kilmarnock on Saturday could move the Buddies up to third in the table. Derek McInnes' side head to Paisley unbeaten in their last two games, but there was disappointment last weekend as they drew 2-2 with Hearts after taking a 2-0 lead. It is set to be an entertaining game with Killie also desperate for points to move them away from the bottom sides. Will Hearts get back to winning ways? After their disappointing 5-1 defeat away to Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League, Hearts head to Aberdeen looking for their first league win since mid September. Robbie Neilson's side struck late to claim a 2-2 draw at Kilmarnock last weekend after a disappointing 4-0 loss at Ibrox. Jim Goodwin will be in the stands again as Aberdeen look to recover from a surprising 4-0 loss at Dundee United in their last match. Victory for the Dons would see them move above Hearts in the table.

For four straight seasons, between 2014/15 and 2017/18, he scored at least 23 league goals; first for Barrow in the National League and National League North, then for Tranmere in the National League. More often than not, posting such eye-catching numbers tempts clubs higher up the footballing pyramid to take a chance on a non-League player, inspired by the immortal Jamie Vardy rags-to-riches story. But he found out that it doesn't always work out that way. \"I was in non-League and scoring 20+ a season and seeing people get moves who had scored 10,\" he tells Sky Sports. \"I got to the point where I was questioning whether it was ever going to happen. It wasn't getting to me, but it was getting to the point where I wanted my chance, though I didn't think anyone would touch me because of my age. \"It was like 'you're on a list of targets, but you're not first choice'. Don't get me wrong, I was gutted at that because I wondered what more I could do.\" \n              Cook wins Sky Bet League Two Player of the Month\n             \n              LIVE League Two table\n             \n              Bradford fixtures\n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             Eventually, though, he did get the chance, a few months before his 28th birthday. Having starred in Tranmere's promotion back to the EFL in 2017/18 - with 28 goals in 47 games in all competitions - he left for League One Walsall after the expiry of his contract and adapted well to the step up, with 18 in 50. Next came a move to Mansfield, 50-odd miles up the A38, but the striker was used sparingly, with most of his appearances coming from the bench. A loan move back to Tranmere was fleeting, but it was a spell at Bradford that reignited his career. The Bantams signed him permanently in the summer of 2021 and he scored 12 as they finished 14th. This season has been a different kettle of fish altogether for both the player and the club, though. Going into Saturday's trip to Salford, Cook - who turns 32 next week - has matched his tally for last season in 14 matches in all competitions - and is giving Erling Haaland a run for his money. Five goals in four games throughout September earned him the Sky Bet League Two Player of the Month award. \"If someone told me if I'd be on this amount of goals at this point, after how the end of last season went, I'd have laughed at them and snatched their hands off,\" he says. \"I started off well last year as well, but then got injured and I didn't think I was the same player. There have been times when I've not been scoring over the years and I've been going into games wondering if I'll ever get the chance to score again. \"But this year, we are getting lots of chances, with the way we play under the gaffer, and, thankfully, I've been in the right place at the right time. \"When I keep on scoring as often as I am, I'm going into every game thinking that if I get a chance, I will score. My confidence is sky high.\" Bradford, meanwhile, sit sixth in the Sky Bet League Two table. The man at the helm, overseeing their resurgence, is two-time Premier League and four-time FA Cup winner Mark Hughes. It was seen as quite the coup when the Welshman took over at the club in February, particularly given his vast experience managing in the top flight. Earlier this season, he made it clear in an interview with Sky Sports, that promotion was the target for the club. Hughes admits his know-how and ambition is rubbing off on the players. \"I know I'm 31, but you're always learning, aren't you? He's not a bad person to learn from,\" Cook adds. \"I probably speak for everyone at the club when I say it's different class working under him. \"I can't say I ever thought I'd play under Mark Hughes, let alone do finishing drills with him, given where he's been and where my career has been. I just try to embrace the opportunity every day.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Cook is in no doubt about where Hughes can take them. \"This year, we've got a set of lads who are thriving at the opportunity to play for Bradford and the expectation is that everyone expects. I've been here for a couple of years now and there's a good vibe. \"Without sounding disrespectful to some of the smaller clubs in the league, they come up [to Valley Parade] and this is like their cup final and they do up their game a bit. Even if we're not playing well, we're getting 18,000 a week, and it's like having an extra man. It can give you that lift that sometimes you need. \"All the lads fight together and we all go out to win every game and you can see that in the dressing room. \"I'm going to be biased, but I think we are definitely capable of promotion if we carry on the form we are in. I know you do drop form over the season, but we need to keep on going and see where we are. \"We proved we can do it against better opposition so, hopefully, if we carry on going and end up getting promoted, we can show next year that we can still compete.\" It has been five seasons since Bradford were a League One club, but with the way things are going for the Bantams at the moment, with Cook in inspired form, it may not be too long before they gain that status once more.

Rai has emphasised the importance of collecting and processing that data to ensure girls from South Asian backgrounds are no longer left behind in women's football. \"Data is important, it is important to know how many South Asian girls are playing in the country,\" added Rai. \"There seem to be more playing at grassroots level [but] then also how many have made the step up to the elite level, because only from there do we know where we go next and what kind of measures we put in place to increase that number.

Five days after his late penalty earned a victory over Liverpool, Saka found a first-half winner against a tricky Bodo/Glimt side who had won their last 14 European matches at home - albeit through fortunate circumstances in a far from convincing display. Saka doesn't need reminding about the importance of big moments, his Euro 2020 final penalty miss for England is proving to be the ultimate education of that, but the hallmark of a champion is producing those occasions regularly. He is doing that. His goal in Norway on Thursday night is his fourth goal in seven consecutive starts for Arsenal. The \"champion mentality\" - which is what one Arsenal scout described him as having at the age of eight - is coming through on the pitch and in his personality. \"To win is the most important thing for me,\" Saka told BT Sport after the game. \"I'm a big believer of being a team player, if we do that [win], I'm leaving the pitch happy.\" Saka even went so far to say how Bodo/Glimt lacked that same mentality as they spurned chance after chance against the Gunners. \"This is football, if you don't score you get punished,\" he added. \"We've had games like that and left the game feeling hard done by.

It turns out Saka either already had that in abundance or is benefiting from this new culture. Eleven wins out of 12 so far this season for Arsenal. The longer they keep Saka fit and firing, the more successful a season they will have.Sam Blitz There was a clear feeling of frustration around Old Trafford as the clock ticked past 90 minutes. Some fans had already headed for the exits. Others were still debating the wisdom of sending on Scott McTominay for Casemiro when Manchester United desperately needed a goal. But the Scot was the surprise match-winner deep into injury-time, finally finding a way past the inspired Francis Uzoho in the Omonia Nicosia goal. After banging at the door all night, United finally got in. Snatching victory against a side sixth in the Cypriot league is hardly something to shout about - but afterwards Erik ten Hag was quietly satisfied with his team's display. \"I'm not concerned,\" he said when asked about only scoring the solitary goal. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Yes, the finishing could have been sharper, he admitted. But 34 shots at goal, against a side defending deep, and compact all night underlined for him his side's perseverance and continuous creativity to try to find a way through. And in the end, for the fourth game in a row, a sub scored for United. Further evidence for him of a growing unity and squad mentality. A draw would have been far from ideal. Embarrassing in the eyes of some. But the win gives United hope of topping their Europa League group. Again, it is a long way from the illustrious achievements of previous United teams to grace this stadium but progress in this competition would be another step forwards for Ten Hag's group. The defeat to Manchester City was a wake-up call of how far United are away from the top of English football right now. It's going to be a long road back. Perspective and patience will be key. Ten Hag and United needed both on Thursday night but got what they needed in the end.Peter Smith West Ham reached the semi-finals of the Europa League last season and are now very well-placed for another long European run. The group winners will advance to the last 16, while whoever finishes second will play an additional two matches in a play-off against the sides that come third in the Europa League. Moyes has mastered the art of using Thursday nights to get his Hammers squad up to speed and, following a sixth win in seven in all competitions, momentum is building in east London. The Scot isn't taking any risks, removing Angelo Ogbonna in the first half as a precaution while Lucas Paqueta was taken off at half-time on a booking. There is now depth to this group and after a shaky start to the campaign, we are seeing the fruits of Moyes' rotation in this competition. Said Benrahma buzzed around menacingly after his free-kick injected confidence into his play. When Paqueta was withdrawn, Pablo Fornals picked up the fight. On the flanks. Vladimir Coufal and Emerson aren't noticeable downgrades, Declan Rice wasn't missed in midfield, Gianluca Scamacca wasn't needed but both were brought on to maintain standards during a second half that had drifted. Stiffer challenges lie ahead in Europe, of course, but with summer signing Nayef Aguerd on his return from injury, all the signs are pointing towards another season of real substance on multiple fronts.Ben Grounds Another Saturday, another £250,000 up for grabs with Super 6.

Cavallo has yet to receive a call-up to Australia's senior squad but has previously said he would be \"scared\" to play at the World Cup in Qatar, where gay sex is a criminal offence. The 2018 edition of football's showpiece event was held in Russia, where a \"gay propaganda\" law, passed in 2013, has been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights activists. \"I vow to stand up for the LGBTQ athletes and the fans at the World Cup in Qatar, who can't live openly, authentically.

He also said that: The Middle East's first World Cup opens on November 19 - the culmination of a 12-year journey since Qatar won a widely-tainted FIFA vote. In that time, Mr Al Khater has risen to chief executive of the supreme committee overseeing Qatar's planning and been in the firing line of criticism. A group of European nations - including England and Wales - have spent the World Cup build-up highlighting concerns about the suffering of migrant workers and claimed inadequacies in Qatar's compensation funding. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mr Al Khater told Sky News: \"A lot of people that speak about this issue on workers' welfare … are not experts in the industry. And they're not experts in what they're speaking about. \"And I feel that they feel obliged, that they need to speak. I think they need to really read and educate themselves a little bit more about what's happening on the ground in Qatar.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A UEFA working group on labour rights in Qatar held talks at FIFA HQ in Switzerland on Wednesday. \"So when people come out and say, 'Yes, we agree that there needs to be some sort of compensation fund',\" Mr Al Khater said. \"They're just reading off a piece of paper. \"So let's leave that to the experts … and let us focus on football. Let the football administrators focus on their teams. And let's just leave it at that.\" While World Cup organisers insist there have only been three work-related deaths at stadiums, concerns linger that more migrant workers died on wider infrastructure work across Qatar as every fatality is not fully investigated. Mr Al Khater pointed to Qatar improving labour laws and the introduction of a minimum wage. But Qatar is not prepared to change anti-LGBTQ+ laws to respond to concerns of visiting fans, while insisting none will be discriminated against during the 29-day tournament and that gay fans can hold hands. \"All we ask is for people to be respectful of the culture,\" Mr Al Khater said. \"At the end of the day, as long as you don't do anything that harms other people, if you're not destroying public property, as long as you're behaving in a way that's not harmful, then everybody's welcome and you have nothing to worry about.\" He added: \"Everybody is welcome here and everyone will feel safe when they come to Qatar.\" Pressed on if that includes LGBTQ+ fans, for example, holding hands in public, Mr Al Khater added: \"Yes. If I held your hand now, and I walked out into the street for hours and hours and hours nobody would say anything to us.\" While Mr Al Khater has said fans can display rainbow flags, he said \"it's a FIFA matter\" whether approval is given for England captain Harry Kane and Wales counterpart Gareth Bale to wear multicoloured \"One Love\" armbands that highlight discrimination. \"From what I understand, there are discussions taking place about the different political messages that are going to be,\" Mr Al Khater said. He added: \"This is a sporting tournament that people want to come [to] and enjoy. Turning it into a platform of political statements I don't think is right for the sport.\" Fans will be attending matches in eight new stadiums built around Doha. Accommodation remains available through organisers but 95 per cent of tickets have been sold, Mr Al Khater said. To host the World Cup, Qatar has had to open up more areas for the sale of alcohol - including outside stadiums and in fan zones - rather than it remaining restricted to hotel bars. Mass gatherings of boisterous, drunken supporters is unfamiliar territory for the first Muslim nation to host a World Cup. Mr Al Khater said: \"There are plans in place for people to sober up if they've been drinking excessively. \"It's a place to make sure that they keep themselves safe, they're not harmful to anybody else.\" Mr Al Khater sidestepped ongoing concerns about whether vote-buying secured the World Cup hosting rights in the vote in 2010 - feeling Qatar has been unfairly targeted generally. \"We've taken the challenge upon ourselves and we've risen to that challenge,\" he said. Asked if he felt criticism was racist, he responded: \"I'm not going to get into what the intentions are of other people, I'm not going to get into the minds and souls of other people. \"But you know, who knows, possibly.\"", "dan-ashworth-newcastles-sporting-director-believes-there-is-no-ceiling-to-clubs-ambitions": "Dan Ashworth says his dream is to help Newcastle challenge at the top of the Premier League - but admits the level of spending that has seen the club splash out £210m since January cannot continue at the same rate.

Claims were made following a video clip shared on social media that Hibernian winger Jair Tavares had allegedly been subjected to racial abuse towards the end of the match, with both clubs and the SPFL launching investigations into the incident. Now they have declared that it was likely to be derogatory rather than racist and most likely came from the away end of the stadium. A statement from Hibs said: \"The investigation, completed in conjunction with our counterparts at Dundee United and the host broadcasters alongside intensive discussions with other stakeholders, focused mainly on the context of the incident and utilised every available video angle and accompanying audio in an attempt to conclusively prove both where the shout emitted from, and also what phrase was shouted. \"Following feedback from the host broadcaster and analysis of the audio mics available, both clubs unequivocally accept the shout came from the stand housing the away fans. \"While there is no conclusive proof to confirm the words used by the offender, all parties are in agreement, based on the evidence available, that the likelihood is the comment was derogatory rather than racial. In no way does this make the abuse acceptable, but it is clear that the initial media clip proved an unreliable and skewed representation of the incident. With the permission of the SPFL, both clubs are happy to share footage which gives better context to the situation. \"Hibernian FC will continue to investigate the matter with Dundee United, the host broadcaster, and other stakeholders, to ensure that the correct outcome is reached. If an individual is identified, then the person will face the strongest action from the Club. \"As a club, Hibernian FC has a zero-tolerance position on all kinds discriminatory and derogatory abuse and finds that behaviour completely abhorrent.

In a wide-ranging interview in the capital, Doha, Nasser Al Khater also told Sky News that enduring criticism of the tournament could be considered racist. He also said that: The Middle East's first World Cup opens on 19 November - the culmination of a 12-year journey since Qatar won a widely-tainted FIFA vote. In that time, Mr Al Khater has risen to chief executive of the supreme committee overseeing Qatar's planning and been in the firing line of criticism. A group of European nations - including England and Wales - has spent the World Cup build-up highlighting concerns about the suffering of migrant workers and claimed inadequacies in Qatar's compensation funding. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mr Al Khater told Sky News: \"A lot of people that speak about this issue on workers' welfare … are not experts in the industry.

Let the football administrators focus on their teams. And let's just leave it at that.\" While World Cup organisers insist there have only been three work-related deaths at stadiums, concerns linger that more migrant workers died on wider infrastructure work across Qatar as every fatality is not fully investigated. Mr Al Khater pointed to Qatar improving labour laws and the introduction of a minimum wage. But Qatar is not prepared to change anti-LGBTQ+ laws to respond to concerns of visiting fans, while insisting none will be discriminated against during the 29-day tournament and that gay fans can hold hands. \"All we ask is for people to be respectful of the culture,\" Mr Al Khater said. \"At the end of the day, as long as you don't do anything that harms other people, if you're not destroying public property, as long as you're behaving in a way that's not harmful, then everybody's welcome and you have nothing to worry about.\" He added: \"Everybody is welcome here and everyone will feel safe when they come to Qatar.\" Pressed on if that includes LBTQ+ fans, for example, holding hands in public, Mr Al Khater added: \"Yes. If I held your hand now, and I walked out into the street for hours and hours and hours nobody would say anything to us.\" While Mr Al Khater has said fans can display rainbow flags, he said \"it's a FIFA matter\" whether approval is given for England captain Harry Kane and Wales counterpart Gareth Bale to wear multicoloured \"One Love\" armbands that highlight discrimination. \"From what I understand, there are discussions taking place about the different political messages that are going to be,\" Mr Al Khater said. He added: \"This is a sporting tournament that people want to come (to) and enjoy. Turning it into a platform of political statements I don't think is right for the sport.\" Fans will be attending matches in eight new stadiums built around Doha. Accommodation remains available through organisers but 95% of tickets have been sold, Mr Al Khater said. To host the World Cup, Qatar has had to open up more areas for the sale of alcohol - including outside stadiums and in fan zones - rather than it remaining restricted to hotel bars. Mass gatherings of boisterous, drunken supporters is unfamiliar territory for the first Muslim nation to host a World Cup. Mr Al Khater said: \"There are plans in place for people to sober up if they've been drinking excessively. \"It's a place to make sure that they keep themselves safe, they're not harmful to anybody else.\" Mr Al Khater sidestepped ongoing concerns about whether vote-buying secured the World Cup hosting rights in the vote in 2010 - feeling Qatar has been unfairly targeted generally. \"We've taken the challenge upon ourselves and we've risen to that challenge,\" he said. Asked if he felt criticism was racist, he responded: \"I'm not going to get into what the intentions are of other people, I'm not going to get into the minds and souls of other people. \"But you know, who knows, possibly.\" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

Mohamed Salah scored the fastest-ever Champions League hat-trick as Liverpool turned it on in the second half to thrash Rangers. Liverpool's spectacular second half, where they scored six goals, meant it was Rangers' heaviest-ever defeat in a competitive match at Ibrox. This was a timely boost for Klopp's men, who face Manchester City on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. \"It changed the mood definitely,\" Klopp said. \"It's completely different. We usually drink a beer after away games but it's that long ago I drunk a beer I'll probably be drunk after one. Yes it changed the mood completely but we all know who we are welcoming on Sunday and this will be a different game, but it's better to go into it with this feeling we've got tonight than any other.\" Two Roberto Firmino goals sent Liverpool on their way and his clever flick allowed Darwin Nunez to net his second goal in as many games. Substitute Salah, who came on in the 68th minute, then took over, scoring the first of his three goals on 75 minutes and securing the match ball with two more ruthless finishes against the hapless Rangers defence. When asked about Salah's hat-trick, Klopp said: \"Special. Typical Mo.

Those were not the words of Jurgen Klopp but you get the impression he would have liked to have gone down that Didi Hamman route when pressed after Liverpool's rampant showing at Ibrox which ended up being Rangers' biggest-ever home defeat in a competitive home match. Klopp admitted the 7-1 thrashing had \"changed the mood\" within the dressing room but is this result going to be the catalyst for a game-changer for Liverpool? In terms of spark levels, this performance was New Year's Eve firework night levels of colour and excitement. Well, for 45 minutes it was.

He was in electric form as he scored two goals, including a superb first-time thunderous volley, to help Spurs take full control against Frankfurt. He even forced the German side's red card as Tuta was sent off for two yellow cards in the space of three minutes for fouls on the South Korean. From there it should have been game over but two minutes after Son came off, Spurs somehow nearly threw away victory to undo all of his good work. The 10 men of Frankfurt made it 3-2 in the 87th minute through Faride Alidou's header and the mood of the game completely changed as Spurs needlessly clung on. The performance up until then had been fairly convincing with the front three of Kane, Son and Richarlison all clicking together nicely. But the final few minutes will serve as a reminder for Spurs and head coach Antonio Conte that there is much work to be done if the club are to compete for trophies this season. The Italian acknowledged that this win could well be a big step in their learning under him. He said in his post-match press conference: \"We are talking about a really good performance but the final part we have to take a big lesson, everybody. \"In the last part of the game, everybody conceded the game ended and for this reason we made a big mistake.\"Declan Olley The first time Erling Haaland has not been in the starting line-up and the first time Manchester City have failed to score this season. Coincidence? Probably. Going down to 10 men against Copenhagen was the real problem for Pep Guardiola, but the goalless draw will not concern him too much. They are still in pole position to win their Champions League group. It will be interesting to know what Haaland thought of Guardiola's decision to leave him on the bench, though. The City boss suggested the Norwegian was \"tired\", but the 22-year-old is looking to create history and Tuesday night would have been another perfect opportunity to add to his remarkable Champions League goal tally. With 28 goals in 22 games, his next strike will see him equal the totals of David Trezeguet (58 appearances), Roy Makaay (61 appearances) and Patrick Kluivert (71 appearances). Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In the past week alone in all competitions, Haaland has scored two goals against Copenhagen, three against Manchester United and one against Southampton. He has 20 already this season. But after starting all of City's 13 games before their trip to Denmark, perhaps he did need a break. Or perhaps Guardiola had one eye on City's next fixture. His star striker is now refreshed for Liverpool on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. A frightening thought for Jurgen Klopp's side.Dan Sansom Mason Mount was only on the pitch for 45 minutes at the San Siro as Chelsea cruised to victory in Milan. That was still enough for him to walk away with the man of the match award, in a fine reminder of his worth to the club - and why three managers in a row have now seen fit to make him a focal point in their midfield. Mount has been validly criticised for his lack of goal contributions in the early weeks of the season, but the Blues hadn't exactly been firing on all cylinders themselves. Just as he had recovered from a slow start to 2021/22, now Mount is flying again. Jeered by some when he came on for England at Wembley last month, his goal against Germany was a catalyst to provide three assists across his next four games, and by the time he took to the pitch in Milan his confidence was clearly restored. Even so, the performance he produced was up there with his best in a Chelsea shirt. Alive to everything, half a second quicker than his adversaries and the architect of both goals - and Fikayo Tomori's red card - the only thing missing was a strike of his own, and even that was only denied by Ciprian Tatarusanu's smart handiwork. Mount is always energetic, and always an asset without the ball, but when he is wasteful with it his contribution can be overlooked, and his output does dwindle. The same could not be said since Graham Potter's arrival. If there is any player the new manager would have loved to work with when he first arrived at Stamford Bridge, it would be him. \"I'm really pleased for him and have been really pleased with him from the start,\" he told BT Sport after full-time. And you can tell he meant it.Ron Walker Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  England's embarrassment of riches at right-back is suddenly looking a little awkward. Firstly, Kyle Walker picks up an abdominal problem, then Trent Alexander-Arnold is forced off against Arsenal. Now Reece James goes off injured against AC Milan in Italy. In contrast to Alexander-Arnold, who was enduring a torrid time of it for Liverpool on Sunday, James was in imperious form for Chelsea in the San Siro. It was his pass in behind Fikayo Tomori that led to the moment that took the game away from Milan. It was an awkward landing that saw him substituted on the hour mark and the hope will be that it is not quite as bad as it looked. But what should be England's strongest area of the pitch has suddenly become even more complicated for Gareth Southgate. A squad of 26 players might allow room for several who are not at optimum fitness but in the same position? The England boss is expected to name his provisional squad next week and could now be doing so with uncertainty over the fitness of his full-backs.Adam Bate It was the same old story for Celtic in the Champions League, missed opportunities cost them vital points once again. The result also means they have equalled Monaco's unwanted record of seven consecutive home defeats in the group stage of the competition. Ange Postecoglou has spoken repeatedly about the step up in quality and his work in progress, but had Celtic taken some of their chances in any of their games so far they would find themselves in a very different position. There was no Callum McGregor for the hosts, but that did not stop Postecoglou sticking to his philosophy of fast, attacking football. Matt O'Riley played in a deeper midfield role and impressed, with Greg Taylor also one of Celtic's standouts, but it was not enough. Celtic's Champions League hopes are over and it will be tough for them to secure the consolation of Europa League football. To achieve that they need at least four points from their final two group matches - at home to Shakhtar Donetsk and away to Real Madrid.

Ousmane Dembele had put Barcelona ahead in the 40th minute, but the opener was cancelled out 10 minutes later by Nicolo Barella. Inter then went ahead just after the hour mark through Lautaro Martinez before Lewandowski's first of the night, as Barcelona looked to have found a way back into the game. They then found themselves behind again inexplicably when Robin Gosens' 89th-minute goal restored the Italian side's lead, but Lewandowski's added-time header would ensure Barcelona's exit from the competition was not confirmed, butwas out of their hands. Elsewhere in Group C, Leon Goretzka scored twice as Bayern Munich stormed to a 4-2 win over Viktoria Plzen. The Bavarian outfit had found the net four times before the 35-minute mark, with Sadio Mane and Thomas Muller the others to put their names on the scoresheet and - despite two second-half goals from the home side - the result was not in doubt.

Also in Liverpool's group, Napoli booked their place in the knockout stages with a 4-2 win over Ajax. Tottenham nervously held on for a 3-2 home win over 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt to go top of Champions League Group D thanks to Heung-Min Son's double. Frankfurt took the lead, before Son's first-half double either side of a Harry Kane penalty ensured they remained top of the group. In the other game in Tottenham's group, Marseille beat Sporting Lisbon 2-0. In Group B, Club Bruges reached the Champions League knockout stage for the first time with a goalless draw at Atletico Madrid.

The technology was due to be introduced after the break for the World Cup, but the Scottish FA and SPFL have announced it will be implemented ahead of schedule. The first televised use of the system will be Hearts vs Celtic, live on Sky Sports, on Saturday October 22. All four 3pm kick-offs that day - Kilmarnock vs Ross County, Motherwell vs Aberdeen, Rangers vs Livingston and St Mirren vs Dundee United - will also use VAR. Scottish FA head of referee operations Crawford Allan told Sky Sports News it makes sense to introduce the technology midway through the season: \"I know there's an opinion out there that you need to wait. \"The analogy I've used is that a club in the January transfer window can sign a new player or new players and improve their product on the field. \n              Scottish Premiership fixtures\n             \n              Scottish Premiership table \n             \n              Scottish Premiership live on Sky Sports \n             \n              Get Sky Sports \n             \"They get to improve their product halfway through the season, they also don't get told 'you signed a player on the 10th of January and in February you're going to play a game that was postponed from December so they're not allowed to play,' you can use the new player. \"VAR is my new player. I want to improve my product on the field of play as soon as I can. \"I think it would be nonsensical that we've spent this amount of money, then a manager phones me in January irate that a penalty wasn't given and we're got VAR sitting there and we could've used it. That doesn't make sense to me.\" Calum Beattie, SPFL chief operating officer, said: \"When 41 out of 42 clubs voted at our general meeting in April to introduce VAR into the cinch Premiership, we said that the technology would be introduced after the World Cup. Our clubs made clear that they wished for VAR to be introduced as soon as possible and the Scottish FA deserve real credit for being able to make this announcement ahead of schedule. \"VAR exists to increase the accuracy of refereeing decision-making and while the experience of other leagues demonstrates that implementation will not be straightforward, we are all committed to assisting the Scottish FA to help it bed in as quickly as possible over the next few months. \"Following the announcement of the biggest television deal in the history of Scottish football with Sky Sports, this is yet another step forward for the game in Scotland. \"The cinch Premiership is currently eighth in the UEFA coefficient rankings thanks to the recent success of our clubs in UEFA competitions and this development brings us into line with other comparable European Leagues. \"We would like to thank our 12 cinch Premiership clubs for embracing the process - and the significant financial commitment - and hope that everyone involved will show a degree of patience and understanding in the initial phase.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Aberdeen: Jim Goodwin \"I think it's a really positive step. We're a little bit behind the rest of the top teams in Europe, but I'm delighted to see that we're going down that route. I think that is the future if the technology is there to help officials and to make sure we get the correct decisions more often than not, then I think it's vital.\" Celtic: Ange Postecoglou \"It's a positive step because you don't want to fall behind the rest of the world and we know it's something that's going to be part of the game for the future. It's great it's coming in.\" Dundee United: Liam Fox \"From my point of view anything that helps officials, coaching staff and players get correct decisions can only be a positive for everybody.\" Hearts: Robbie Neilson \"Obviously we would've liked it to have come in at the start of the season, but it's understandable the processes and we have to make sure it's bang on. I'm delighted we're getting it and I think it's really important that we have it in Scottish football.\" Hibernian: Lee Johnson \"We had a talk from the referees and the association, particularly on VAR and I think the only question that surprised me was that it was being introduced halfway through the season. Overall I'm looking forward to that justice really because as a manager that's what you want.\" Kilmarnock: Derek McInnes \"It's not before time to be honest and we're looking forward to having it. I think we'll all feel the strength of frustration with it, there's never a week that goes by without incident, but I do think it's less controversial moments that were maybe there previously.\" Livingston: David Martindale \"We've acted very quickly and had all the infrastructure in place, so we've just been waiting. I think it's been a case of the sooner the better, we've got to go and help the officials.\" Motherwell: Steven Hammell \"I think from the club's point of view it's good that it's being introduced, it's something that's progressive and it's something we want to see. The idea of it getting introduced after the season has started is not ideal, there will be decisions in those early games that could be deciding points and ultimately positions in the league that could be decided before then.\" Rangers: Giovanni van Bronckhorst \"It's very good for everyone because it will make the decisions the referees make on the pitch even better. It will sometimes be in favour, sometimes it's against you but I think overall it's the most clear way for everyone.\" Ross County: Malky Mackay \"It is going to cause a lot of conversation and debate but, at the same time, what it's going to do eventually is negate mistakes and the percentage level of mistakes will come down. That can only be good for the game.\" St Johnstone: Callum Davidson \"There's no point complaining anymore that it was a handball or it was offside because it's going to be checked anyway, so that's a good thing. I think there's still contentious rules which makes it still difficult for VAR, but it will help get the big decisions right.\" St Mirren: Stephen Robinson \"Anything that makes the game better. We've been behind it really in terms of getting it done, but we're finally getting there. I was a big advocate for it when I was previously in Scotland, but having seen some of the ways it's used it's changing the game. Referees do need all the help they can get and if it's a move in the right direction then certainly it'll help the game.\" We have seen VAR implemented all over the world across many different leagues so you might know what to expect. With extra referees reviewing clear and obvious errors, ultimately it is there to give officials more support and ensure any clear and obvious errors are rectified. The SFA system will be identical to the one used by football's world governing body, FIFA, with the principle of \"minimum interference, maximum benefit\". In addition, baselines set out by FIFA for when a review may take place are limited to penalties, red cards, goal situations and any case of mistaken identity. VAR is expected to cost around £1.2m per season and Premiership clubs will pay for the technology with each club's share depending on their final league position. The Premiership winners will pay approximately £195,000 per season, with a sliding scale to the 12th club, who would pay around £67,000. The training for officials has been carried out by the SFA, with Allan adding that when it comes to allocating funds for VAR, it should be looked upon as an investment rather than a cost. \"Cost is an interesting one. If I was moving Scottish football forward - and I am part of the football family - I'd like to think of it as an investment in Scottish football rather than a cost,\" he said.

French online newspaper Mediapart says PSG have used a communications agency to create fake social media accounts to attack football figures, including Mbappe. The club responded to the claims by saying: \"Paris Saint-Germain completely and totally denies the claims of Mediapart. PSG is a global brand and engages with social media agencies all around the world all the time - local and international - to promote and celebrate the great work of the Club, its people and partners - like every business. \"The club has never contracted with an agency to undermine any person or institution.\" A senior source at the club added: \"Do you really think we hired an agency to attack our own players?

Asked how this will play out, the source added: \"They will probably kiss and make up, but this will keep flaring up again and again\". Reports in Spanish media on Tuesday claimed that Mbappe was going to a bullfight in Madrid today. But, according to his social media, Mbappe will be at a charity event in Nimes this afternoon. PSG sources believe the stories about Mbappe are coming out of Spain and are intended to destabilise PSG. They claim the reports are \"utter nonsense\" and \"complete rubbish\".

He's being asked to play as a central striker and he doesn't like the tactics the new head coach Christophe Galtier is using. \"Also, his relationship with Neymar is not great. There have historically been problems between the two players and he's also unhappy with PSG's transfer strategy in the summer. \"If we go back a few months, everyone was expecting him to leave PSG because his contract was running out and everyone was expecting him to move to Real Madrid. \"He changed his mind and signed a new contract at PSG, but promises were made to him about the strategy of the club and he feels those promises weren't kept. So there are quite a few reasons why he's unhappy.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  European football expert Kevin Hatchard speaking on Sky Sports News: \"I think there's an element of posturing here to be honest. PSG were desperate for him to sign a new contract in the summer and he felt he was going to have a lot of influence and there was the feeling that he had a shopping list of what he wanted. \"Part of it was that he thought Neymar was going to leave the club in the summer and the opposite has happened: he's playing well and scoring and making goals alongside Lionel Messi. They had that link at Barcelona. Mbappe is playing centre-forward and that's not what he wanted to do. \"There was a message on social media recently - #pivotgang - which implies he wants a centre-forward to play off instead of being the number nine. He's not happy about that and some of the transfer business. \"But realistically - where is he going to go? He shut the door on Real Madrid in the summer, I think they were quite wounded by that and it would be a climb down for Real to then go and spend £200m on a player they could have got for free a few months ago. \"There are clubs who have the numbers. A club like Newcastle, for example, would be desperate to try and make a statement signing but even they are not free and easy on what they can do in the market. \"It's a difficult situation for him because there are very few clubs who could put across the package that PSG would want and then he personally would want.

It is that desire to make the move into football management that has taken him on a journey to the Cambodian Premier League For the past year, he has been in Siem Reap - more famous as the gateway to Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world - as the manager of Angkor Tiger. It is a role that has tested him on the pitch and off it but Heath has no regrets about his decision. \"I am a football manager,\" he tells Sky Sports. \"If you ask 95 per cent of people in England if they would move to Cambodia you would probably get a lot of negative answers because it is not on a lot of people's lists. But this is what I have set out to be since I was 17. \"I did not have the fortune to play football professionally. The offer came and it was not something that I could turn down. Football management is tough. There have been a lot of sacrifices but it is probably the best decision that I have ever made.\" He took a pay cut for this opportunity and acknowledges that was a gamble. \"If I get the sack, what am I going to do? It was a risk but you have to take the risk, don't you, for the chance to get on?\" There is not a long list of support staff for him to lean on either. He has a Japanese assistant. \"He is 28. A good lad.\" His German fitness coach doubles up as the physiotherapist. The side's forward, Leicester academy graduate Jozsef Keaveny, has been a useful sounding board despite being only 22. \"There is not a big team.\" But this is the path that he has chosen for himself. A former Birmingham City season-ticket holder - \"I learned nothing watching them!\" - his journey began as a teenager coaching Buxton's under-nines. \"Even then, I was adamant I wanted to be a manager.\" \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Transfer Centre LIVE!\n             \n              Football fixtures\n             \n              Football features\n             Two-and-a-half years were spent on a project coaching Thailand national team players aged from 16 to 21 as part of an initiative within Leicester's academy. When the pandemic ended that, Heath, 37, took up a role with the Premier League side's U14 age group. \"It was a good experience but I wanted to manage. Academies are all about player development, which is fine, but I love the thrill of winning a game of football. That buzz of being in charge of that team is something that I cannot get anywhere else. \"I am like it when I play any sport. I run and I cycle. I swim but after 10 lengths I am bored. I prefer squash or racquetball. I need a sport where you are playing for points. It is all about that competitive nature. It is that 90 minutes in a different zone. I cannot explain it. \"So I got myself an agent and something in Cambodia came up and we started talking. I managed to get an interview but I did not think it would go far. I have been to Thailand so many times through work, I thought it would be the same but it is very different. \"I am working with a lot of players who have never left Cambodia. They know what they know and if you tell them to turn up at 8am, they are going to turn up at 7.45am. They work hard and will never stop. They keep going and going. But improvement is needed.\" On the pitch, it has been an education. The team is sixth in the eight-team Cambodian Premier League, at no risk of relegation but playing merely for pride with two games remaining. With crowds in excess of 3,000 people, there can be no let up. \"Early on, I thought we overachieved a little bit. We were attacking well. There was a lot of work to implement the style that I wanted and the highs outweighed the lows. Then injuries hit, confidence was hit, and all of a sudden we were conceding goals. \"It would not be an exaggeration to say that I have learned something every day. How to talk to players and manage different personalities. What to say and when to say it. Building the best squad. Dealing with losing. How to get that team-talk right. \"The big challenge is making decisions alone. I am questioning myself all the time because there is nobody else. I can speak to people back home but they can only give their opinion based on what I am saying not what they are seeing. I have had to criticise myself a lot.\" He has enjoyed the support of the people. \"I have been fortunate. The fans have been great with me. I interact with them a lot, I get stopped when walking around town. We might not have the budget to match that but the interest is absolutely there.\" But the biggest challenges have been away from football. \"From a tourist point of view, you would look at it very differently. Angkor Wat is the main point of interest, of course. People go on holiday and think, 'I could live here.' Nine times out of 10, they couldn't. Living here is difficult.

Over the past five years, England have been spoilt with a hefty amount of right-back options, with manager Gareth Southgate adopting a reputation for having an infatuation with players in that position. \"People say I have an obsession with right-backs, but I just see four very good footballers,\" said Southgate after he picked a quartet of options in that role before Euro 2020. Going into this winter's World Cup in Qatar, there was little doubt about the personnel or the quality of options available at Southgate's disposal once again. But injuries to three of England's most-qualified options in that position, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James and Kyle Walker, during this month have raised worrying concerns. \"It's staggering really, what's happened,\" said former England defender and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville. \"A few weeks ago, it's probably the strongest department and you're thinking one of those really talented right-backs may be left out. Now we're in trouble in that position. \"So I'm hopeful we can get at least two of them out of that three back fit again, because it would be a massive problem if they weren't. I think one or two of them will be fit.\" So where do we stand with the three that are injured? Will the trio make the tournament? And who is on standby in the event that all or some are missing? Sky Sports answers all the important questions below... \n              Pick your England World Cup XI\n             \n              2022 World Cup: Teams, schedule, venues\n             \n              World Cup fixtures\n             \n              Latest World Cup news\n             The first of the right-backs to fall injured was Manchester City's Kyle Walker, who aggravated a long-standing groin injury during the 6-3 derby victory against Man United earlier in October. Walker required surgery on the problem because the injury he sustained could not be managed while still playing due to the pace the City defender runs at. Sky Sports News understands Walker and England are hopeful the 32-year-old will be fit in time to fly to Qatar - but the nature of the injury and the timeline in place means the situation is touch-and-go. Walker is widely known to be a quick healer due to his recovery from past injuries but his availability for Qatar will largely depend on the speed at which he recovers. The next week or so will be crucial in learning whether Walker is on track, but City manager Pep Guardiola could not confirm whether the right-back will be fit in time for the tournament. The City defender's role in the England squad is more crucial compared to his other right-back options due to his flexibility across different formations. Walker has developed a reputation of juggling a back four role with City and a back three position with England in recent tournaments - while his pace is something that very few players, let alone defenders, can match this winter. Only Erling Haaland has clocked a faster speed at City in the Premier League this term. Perhaps the most worrying injury concern at right-back is Chelsea's Reece James, who limped out of the Blues' 2-0 Champions League win at AC Milan in midweek. The Blues have now confirmed James' knee setback is worse than first feared and he is expected to miss up to eight weeks of action, practically ruling him out of the entire tournament. Should that come to pass, it would be a real shame as the 22-year-old has emerged as one of the Premier League's best players. The England international is also widely considered to balance defensive and attacking duties with greater efficiency than Alexander-Arnold. Since becoming a regular at Chelsea in 2020/21, James ranks third among Premier League full-backs for goals and assists and frequently wins recoveries higher up the pitch. Frequently deployed as a wing-back, the 22-year-old has also displayed considerable positional fluidity and can play in midfield - while the graphic above reveals his tendency to drift into central areas. Southgate has used wing-backs in most recent England matches and James would have been a prime contender to start on the right of a back five in Qatar. The England manager is set to have a rethink for that position, with James' participation potential in serious doubt. The Liverpool right-back was ruled out for two weeks after picking up an ankle problem in his side's 3-2 loss at Arsenal. Alexander-Arnold missed Liverpool's game against Rangers, but made a quicker-than-anticipated return as a late substitute in the 1-0 win against Manchester City. Alexander-Arnold has another eight games to impress Southgate before the England manager has to submit his final 26-man squad to FIFA ahead of the World Cup. These eight games will be crucial for the 24-year-old's chances given the poor defensive form the Liverpool man was in before his injury. Alexander-Arnold was strongly criticised for his defensive displays against Fulham, Manchester United and Napoli in August and September, before a horrendous start to October. The Liverpool right-back was at fault for all of Leandro Trossard's goals in the 3-3 draw with Brighton, before two goals went in on his side against Arsenal earlier this month. There is also the question of where does Alexander-Arnold fit in with regards to the England set-up? The Liverpool defender has little to no club experience of playing as a wing-back, with Reece James and Kieran Trippier already ahead of him in that queue, while all of his four right-back rivals are more in form than him going into the tournament. The 24-year-old does bring a lot to Liverpool and England's game from an attacking sense, which does counter his critics. This term, Alexander-Arnold has clocked 1.63 expected assists but failed to create a goal in the Premier League - which suggests the blame should rest elsewhere for his side's attacking struggles. While his defending and positioning are often criticised, the right-back still registers impressive numbers for regaining possession in the defensive and final thirds, while his passing range and threat from set-pieces is arguably unrivalled. However, the lack of defensive astuteness means his place in the 26-man squad is seriously under threat - even with James and Walker suffering more severe injury blows recently. The triple injury concern leaves Kieran Trippier as the only recognisable right-back fully fit from Southgate's most recent England squad - and even the Newcastle man has a long history of injury woes which add further doubt. But should he be fit for Qatar, Trippier ticks all the boxes of being an all-round player, while few players pose more of a threat from dead ball situations. Compared to Alexander-Arnold, Trippier has shown this season that he can rival the Liverpool player in terms of attacking output. The seasoned full-back has attempted a league-topping 82 crosses for Newcastle this term and ranks third in the division for expected assists, through-balls and passes in the final third. There's defensive reliability from Trippier too - the 32-year-old is among the elite for regaining possession in the middle third - helping his side maintain the ball and he aids in preventing counters in Newcastle's new, advanced style under Eddie Howe. Capable of playing right-back or left-back in a back four, as well as right wing-back should Southgate prefer a back five, do not be surprised if the England manager puts all his eggs into the reliable Trippier's basket. By far and away the prime standby candidate to come into the England fold in the event of a right-back injury is Ben White, who is excelling on the right of league leaders Arsenal's defence. White's versatility makes him a classic 'Southgate player' when it comes to England - the manager has regularly picked and favoured players who can adopt multiple positions such as Walker, Trippier, Bukayo Saka and Raheem Sterling. The Arsenal defender is naturally a centre-back but has been starring for the Gunners at right-back this term - while he can also feature at right centre-back in a three and - if needed - central midfield. White's tactical game is diverse too. He started the season by adopting infield positions at right-back - but showed in recent matches against Tottenham and Liverpool that he can bomb forward around the outside of his right winger, this being England international Saka at Arsenal. A part of the Euro 2020 squad two summers ago, White has some experience of being in a tournament football environment and - considering his last two England caps came in a right-back role - Southgate is facing real questions as to why the Arsenal defender is not in this autumn picture already. Only two other right-backs have been selected by Southgate in the last 12 months - Southampton's Kyle Walker-Peters and Leicester full-back James Justin. It's harder to compare the attacking qualities of full-backs from clubs currently battling at the wrong end of the table, but Justin certainly stands out at his club this term. Formidable in the air, the 24-year-old has covered down both flanks and registered team-topping numbers for winning duels and blocking crosses. But Justin also excels on the ball with only Harvey Barnes taking more touches on the ball or attempting more dribbles this season. The only issue for Justin is that he is too similar in profile to Trippier in the way he can adopt both flanks - and with plenty of competition on those two areas, the 24-year-old seems too far down the queue for a realistic call-up. As is the case with Justin, Walker-Peters' statistics are harder to contextualise with Southampton currently sat 17th in the table. The radar below reveals an all-round effectiveness to his game, notably for attempting dribbles and crosses.  Based on historical returns, his high reading for goalscoring is arguably skewed due to the limited number of games so far - currently boosted by his solitary goal against Leeds in August. However, the 25-year-old has proven his defensive attributes over the years and his above-average returns for winning duels exemplifies this best.

Sheffield United are top of the Championship. Since the Yorkshireman was appointed last November, the team have picked up 79 points – 10 more than anyone else. But it has not been easy. The manager of the month for September has seen his side go three without a win in October. One point from those three games is the worst run since he was appointed and there is no great mystery as to why. He is without nine players. Seven are defenders. Shorn of his wing-backs, it necessitated a switch to a back four for the defeat to Stoke on Saturday with young Kyron Gordon at right-back. Ahead of the defence, John Fleck broke his leg in August. Sander Berge was injured late on against Queens Park Rangers. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"I have not taken a coaching session properly for about seven weeks,\" says Heckingbottom. \"When we have had players train, there have not been the bodies out there so it has just been individual work. During the international break, we only had four players. \"It has just been a case of wrapping the players up. For me, it is frustrating when I am just coaching on the tactics board or with the video analysis. I want to be on the grass with the players getting stuck in. Hopefully, that time will come soon.\" Heckingbottom is not whining, just blunt. This time last year, Sheffield United were in the midst of losing five games out of eight under Slavisa Jokanovic and found themselves in the wrong half of the Championship table. He has been a restorative influence. There was a return to three at the back, playing a system that suited the personnel, one they were familiar with from more successful times under Chris Wilder. It took a penalty shootout defeat to Nottingham Forest to end hopes of promotion through the play-offs. \n              Championship table\n             \n              Championship fixtures\n             \n              Live on Sky Sports\n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             The challenge this season has been to ensure that momentum was not lost. \"Straight after the Forest game we had a few beers back at Bramall Lane. Everyone was disappointed. But we wanted everyone to be together and send everyone away with that message. \"In my position, you don't feel it. You just move on to the next. But you are aware it is a major hangover for the players and for the fans. We certainly made a conscious effort to make things fresh and bring lots of energy from the first moment we came back. \"We have obviously had to cut our cloth accordingly with it being another season in the Championship, the budget coming down and losing some good players. But we have managed to recruit some good players and found a good balance to the squad.\" The signing of Anel Ahmedhodzic has helped. \"He always wanted to be here. We could not get it done in January so he ended up going to Bordeaux and attracted a lot of attention there but he always wanted to be here and could not get us out of his head.\" The 23-year-old defender is already a fan favourite and it is easy to understand why. Sheffield United have won seven of the eight games that he has started, drawing the other. They are without a win in the five games that he has missed. \"He was our first choice and we were desperate to bring him in. Just because you could see him playing in the red and white, the role we wanted him to play, the way we play, we could see him fitting into that. I think it excited him. He has slotted in perfectly.\" Others have improved. Iliman Ndiaye, the 22-year-old signed from Boreham Wood in 2019, has been the outstanding forward this season, bringing a more fluid movement to the team in the final third of the pitch. \"When I came to the club he was just back from a loan at Hyde and he impressed me straightaway,\" recalls Heckingbottom. \"He has kicked on and on. As soon as he got into the first team, you could see he was good enough. It was just a case of him trying to be the best player he could be. He has got himself into the Senegal squad and it would be fantastic if he could go to the World Cup.\" Heckingbottom was aware of Ndiaye's talent having been Sheffield United's U23 coach before taking the top job. He believes it has helped. \"I had been part of some of their journeys already so I felt invested and I knew what the club was about,\" he explains. \"In other jobs, I have gone straight in as the manager. This time, I have actually had 18 months performing other roles within the club, getting to know the players, the staff and the fans. I feel lucky with that because when I stepped up I felt a lot more responsibility.\" Perhaps that also explains why he has appeared more in tune with the supporters' demands of their team than his predecessor. Having also been the interim manager following Wilder's departure, Heckingbottom feels more of a natural bridge to those years. \"I like the bravery that we play with. We know we are not going to win every game but we can still be that team that is on the front foot trying to force the issue. We want the possession to mean something. We want efforts on goal and bodies in the box. \"Listen, we want to do it in a way that has control but we do want to play forwards and risk possession. If we lose the ball, fine. Just try to win it back as quickly as possible. Those are our simple rules. I don't want us to be boring. I want us to be exciting and take risks. \"At times we have had our middle centre-back playing diagonal balls in behind to our left centre-back. We are trying to improve. If you only ever do the same thing then you become easier to play against so we are constantly looking to see what we can do next.  \"We are also conscious that because of how we want to play the game most of the teams who play against us will have their joy on the counter-attack so we have worked hard on stopping that, while still committing the same if not more bodies forward. \"But we do not want to be gung-ho. We are very conscious that most teams play on the counter-attack so we have to work to stop that. One of the problems against QPR was that we started chasing the game and we weren't us. We still want a lot of control.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Perhaps that will return soon. Ahmedhodzic, still unbeaten in the Championship with Sheffield United, is expected to be fit for the game against Blackpool on Saturday. Next month will see other key players available once more. The promotion push can resume. \"We are not hiding that it is our goal. It is everyone's goal. Everyone thinks they have a chance. But we can take confidence from the fact that we have done it for quite a long period of time. We are improving but we have been like this for 11 months now.\" Unfortunately, there are no prizes for that. \"We cannot shift the dates.

A five-goal defeat to MK Dons on their own patch ended their hopes. They had been eyeing automatic promotion with five games to go but won none of them and missed out on the play-offs. As the supporters trudged away from Home Park that April afternoon, it would have been easy to mistake this for the end of the adventure. Plymouth manager Steven Schumacher saw it differently. That day proved to be a turning point for his team. \"It was a crushing defeat,\" Schumacher tells Sky Sports. \"I watched and watched and watched it. Yes, we watch every game back and you always learn something from your team, win or lose. But that MK Dons game was a real eye-opener.\" It was their 3-4-3 formation that did it. \"They had options, movement and rotation in that system. They also had similar personnel to us and we felt that if we could just recruit one or two to play those No 10 roles how MK Dons did it, that would help us.\" The results since have been spectacular. Plymouth have won eight of their last nine league games to go top of League One. In front of their own fans, they have been formidable, winning all seven matches so far. That tactical tweak has helped. \"Last year, we played 3-5-2 pretty much the whole season and I think that might have made us a bit predictable to play against, particularly in the run-in,\" says Schumacher. \"Our change of shape has allowed us to vary it tactically and has given us an advantage.\" They have needed that edge because it has been a tough run. \"We looked at the fixtures when they first came out and we felt all the teams we were going to play were going to be up there at the end. There were a lot of big names in the first 10 to 12 games.\" \n              League One table\n             \n              League One fixtures\n             \n              Live on Sky Sports\n             \n              Football features\n             There was a trip to Derby County. Plymouth beat them thanks to Sam Cosgrove's last-minute winner. Bolton, Ipswich and Sheffield Wednesday all came to Home Park and all were beaten. It was another stoppage-time goal from Cosgrove that saw off the Owls. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"It was such a good goal. For the last 15 minutes we could just sense our team was getting a bit stronger. It felt like we had that belief we could get that winner. We had done it before and once you have done something once you have that belief you can do it again.\" The belief around Plymouth is palpable now. There is the feeling of a club on the up. Stadium improvements have helped. A supporter-funded statue of Jack Leslie, the first Black player to be called up by England, stands proudly outside the ground. Crowds are up. Jack Leslie, the first black footballer to receive an England call-up, awarded posthumous honorary cap There were 16,381 supporters at Home Park for the win over Wednesday. Ticket revenue has increased by over 50 per cent in the past four years and the club has just filed accounts showing its highest ever turnover. Schumacher is keen to put it in context. \"I still think we are punching above our weight from a financial point of view. This year our budget might be the 13th or 14th biggest in League One because we have increased it slightly. Last year, we probably had the 16th or 17th biggest and we got 80 points. \"We know where we are at as a club. We cannot compete financially with Ipswich, Sheffield Wednesday, Derby, Bolton and Portsmouth. We have not got the finances that they have just yet so we have to think smarter. That is the brief from the owner and the CEO. \"That means better data analysis, better recruitment processes. That is what gives us the chance to be competitive. We have proven this season and last that we can compete. We want to keep improving every single week and see where it takes us.\" Working smarter means using data to identify players who can make a difference. Finn Azaz came in on loan from Aston Villa after impressing at Newport. They liked what they saw of Swansea's Morgan Whittaker during his spell at Lincoln and brought him in too. Bali Mumba, on loan from Norwich, has shone at wing-back. Nigel Longwijk from Wolves has contributed. And then there is Cosgrove, on loan from Birmingham, and averaging a league goal every 55 minutes - a scoring rate only bettered by Erling Haaland. \"The loan players have really shone, along with Matt Butcher, who we brought in permanently and has been really consistent. That has been a big improvement. We managed to bring in some players who have given us more depth and quality. \"We now have a full-time data scientist who looks through key attributes up and down the leagues. We match that to whether we feel they would fit our system. We highlighted all the loan players and we knew the areas of the pitch that we wanted to strengthen in. \"We went out and found the best players for those roles. Then we spoke to the players, their agents and their parent clubs to explain why this was the right place for them to come and improve their own games and most importantly improve our team.\" They were all signed with the new system in mind. \"Last year, we could not play this 3-4-3 that we recruited for. Now, there are tactical variations that we can pose. We can switch to a back four comfortably. I think it is important to be adaptable.\" “I thank everyone for their efforts. I understand that I am the manager who gets the focus and does the interviews but without the whole team then none of it is possible. Our job is to prepare the players but it is the players’ job to perform. So it is a big thank you to all the staff but a huge thank you to the players who have got the points in this tough start.” Better data analysis. Better recruitment. Better coaching? \"Hopefully. We had to work really hard in the summer and put some good coaching hours in with the players. Thankfully, they have taken that information on board and adapted really well.\" He is too modest to push the point but his in-game management has been a feature. Sheffield Wednesday boss Darren Moore was criticised for withdrawing Josh Windass and Barry Bannan against Plymouth. Schumacher brought on the match-winner. Cosgrove has scored three goals off the bench this season, but he is not alone. Ryan Hardie has done that too, scoring his third against Accrington at the weekend. Whittaker came on to score the winner against Oxford. Niall Ennis found the net against Portsmouth. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It all helps to explain why Schumacher is so popular at Plymouth, the place that this 38-year-old Scouser has called home since moving down with his family as assistant to predecessor Ryan Lowe in 2019. \"We love it here and have settled really well,\" he says. \"It is a fantastic football club to work for, really good owners with a vision for where they want to get to and a process of how to get there. The fans are getting on board, everyone is excited. It is all going in the right direction, we just want that to continue.\" Will he finish the job this time? That is the goal. \"When the players came back in the summer, we told them the aim was to go one better.\" Twelve years have passed since Plymouth last played in the Championship. Their exile could soon come to an end. \"It would mean absolutely everything because I know how much this club means to the people here. I am working as hard as possible to make the people as happy as I can and try to get Plymouth Argyle back to the Championship where we all feel it belongs.\" It is credit to Schumacher's humility as well as his ability as a coach, that the catalyst for the club's extraordinary start to the season came amid the carnage of that chastening defeat in the spring.

Cromwell and Greene received written warnings following a joint NWSL/NWSL Players' Association investigation in March after some allegations of verbal abuse and improper favouritism against them were substantiated. The coaches were then found to have been participating in retaliatory behaviour towards players they thought had either made complaints against them or supported the investigation. They had also taken negative action against certain players by seeking to waive their contracts or trade them. Goalkeeper coach Aline Reis was found to have pressured players into sharing favourable information with the investigators and has been placed on administrative leave. All three coaches - Cromwell, Greene and Reis - alleged that they were subjected to various types of misconduct during the NWSL/NWSLPA joint investigation, but a third-party investigator found their complaints to be unsubstantiated. Cromwell and Greene \"are ineligible to work in the NWSL in any capacity unless or until approved by the commissioner,\" a league statement read. To regain eligibility to coach in the NWSL, the trio must undertake mandatory training regarding retaliation, discrimination, harassment and bullying and also executive coaching, as determined by the commissioner. Cromwell, Greene and Reis must also acknowledge wrongdoing and demonstrate a sincere commitment to modifying their behaviour. Reis, meanwhile, can return to work when she is taking part in the executive coaching requirement.

These are the moments you have to capitalise on to really move the conversation forward and create a safe platform for people to have these conversations. What better picture than to see the England captain and players taking that massive step?\" Liew: \"I think it's a pathetically weak gesture, which isn't quite a rainbow and doesn't really say anything about what you want to see. Something must happen, but we're not quite sure what. \"I do get that the England FA and other federations are prepared to take a fine, which will be what? Ten thousand euros, 20,000 euros? That's two pints in Qatar. So frankly it's the lowest of low bars for FIFA to clear in terms of sanctioning this very small protest and yet again FIFA have failed to clear it.\" Nicolaou: \"But for someone, somewhere that gesture could mean everything. It could give them the confidence to say something - or think about saying it - whether it's about themselves...\" Liew: \"They could have made a stronger gesture, that's all I'm saying.\" Nicolaou: \"Well, why are we having these conversations a month before the World Cup, these are conversations we should have had years ago and prior to that. The fact these topics are coming up now and the World Cup is literally around the corner. \"I think there are people that will take whatever we can to have that presence and to have that visual in a country where things aren't so easy and simple as they are in other spots in the world.\" Correctly predict six scorelines to win £250,000 for free with Super 6.

The Sky Sports England World Cup squad ladder returns! The clock is ticking as Gareth Southgate prepares to name his preliminary squad for Qatar 2022 on October 20 and our ladder, updated weekly and made up of the top 40 players in contention, ranks the latest risers and fallers. Maguire's continued absence for Manchester United means his place on the plane is in jeopardy and there is plenty of movement elsewhere too, including three new entries. Join us as we run through the players on the plane, those sitting in the departure lounge with their boarding passes in hand, and those stuck in traffic in a taxi on their way to the airport. Last week we had Harry Maguire at 14th in our ladder, the centre-back clinging to his place on the plane by virtue of his importance to Gareth Southgate. With no news of a return to fitness, however, he has slipped to 15th, putting him in the departure lounge. Maguire has not featured for United since picking up an apparent hamstring injury during an error-strewn performance in England's 3-3 draw with Germany at Wembley two weeks ago. He was not involved at all in United's 2-1 win over Everton on Sunday, with one report claiming he has been allowed to travel to Portugal on holiday in order to \"clear his head\". Time is running out for him to regain fitness - let alone find some much-needed form. \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             \n              Live football on Sky Sports this week\n             \n              Get NOW to stream big moments\n             Kieran Trippier (14th) is the man to have leapfrogged Maguire, moving from departure lounge to plane having impressed again for Newcastle in their 5-1 win over Brentford, grabbing an assist with his superb cross for the opening goal. There are ups and downs further up the ladder too, with Raheem Sterling (6th) dropping two places having been benched for Chelsea's 3-0 win over Wolves on Saturday. The 27-year-old has not found the net in the Premier League since August, but it's a different story for Phil Foden, who moves up to fourth having scored yet again for Manchester City in their 4-0 thrashing of Southampton. Foden's Manchester City team-mate John Stones has dropped a couple of places to 12th, with manager Pep Guardiola revealing he is still not fit enough to take part in training as he struggles with a hamstring problem. What a week for Ben White (25th). The Arsenal man was down in 32nd last week but Kyle Walker's groin injury, which has seen the Manchester City defender drop 13 places, coupled with his own excellent form, has significantly boosted his selection prospects. It previously seemed that playing at right-back for Arsenal had diminished White's World Cup hopes but Walker's injury, which makes him a major doubt for the tournament, means Southgate suddenly needs a player with the versatility to play there as well as at centre-back. White, superb in Arsenal's 3-2 win over Liverpool, fits the bill. The former Brighton man is rated by Southgate having been part of England's Euro 2020 squad. He is comfortable in a back three, and it is also worth noting he was used at right-back in his last two appearances for the national team, against Switzerland and Ivory Coast in March. White is the biggest climber in this week's ladder but he is not the only upwardly-mobile player in the departure lounge. Jarrod Bowen (21st) has climbed four places having scored for a second consecutive Premier League game in West Ham's 3-1 win over Fulham, while Marcus Rashford (23rd) has risen five places having put his poor showing in the Manchester derby behind him with a match-winning cameo in the Europa League against Omonoia Nicosia, and another bright performance in United's 2-1 win over Everton on Sunday. Rashford is a new entry in the departure lounge and so too is Newcastle's Callum Wilson (26th), who impressed again for Newcastle, grabbing an assist and generally looking dangerous in their 5-1 win over Brentford. Conor Gallagher, meanwhile, continues to look a good bet to earn a place in Southgate's squad having moved up two places to 24th in our ladder after catching the eye again in Chelsea's 3-0 win over Wolves, showing his versatility by starting on the right-hand side of Graham Potter's attack. The final section of the ladder, made up of players hoping their taxis reach the airport in time, includes three new entries this week, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek (34th) the most intriguing. The 26-year-old is impressing under new Chelsea boss Potter and his form will not have gone unnoticed by Southgate, who of course had him in his squad for the last World Cup in Russia. More of the same from Loftus-Cheek between now and the squad announcement is sure to make him a tempting option to Southgate and the England boss will also be monitoring Harvey Barnes (35th), who is finding form with Leicester, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin (40th), who has just returned from injury for Everton. Those players, together with James Maddison (29th), who scored twice in Leicester's 4-0 win over Nottingham Forest last week, appear to be making late pushes for Southgate's squad but others are slipping out of contention. Tammy Abraham (27th) and James Ward-Prowse (28th) look vulnerable as other players in their position are in better form, while AC Milan's Fikayo Tomori has also dropped (31st) after an error-strewn performance against his former club Chelsea last week. Trent Alexander-Arnold's prospects look even bleaker, the Liverpool full-back dropping to 36th after another nightmarish afternoon, this time up against Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli on Sunday, his poor form compounded by an apparent ankle strain. It was another bad week for Jadon Sancho (39th), too. The former Borussia Dortmund winger was hooked at half-time during Manchester United's Europa League meeting with Omonoia Nicosia last week and didn't even make it off the bench against Everton on Sunday.

INCIDENT: Granit Xhaka crosses the ball into the Liverpool box and Gabriel Jesus competes for the ball with Thiago Alcantara. The Arsenal striker goes down under Thiago's challenge and Michael Oliver immediately awards the penalty. VAR does not intervene to either look or overturn the decision. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  DERMOT'S VERDICT: Incorrect decision. DERMOT SAYS: I think it raises two issues. Firstly, it's not in line with what has changed this season. The League has raised the threshold and there's more physical contact. Without doubt, Thiago doesn't get the ball and makes contact with Jesus. But is it enough to give a penalty? I think not. The next problem is when it's thrown to the VAR, Michael Oliver will say to the VAR: he doesn't get the ball, he made contact with the player which he has. So there's no evidence that he has made an incorrect decision, the VAR has to stay out. It will always default to the referee's decision. INCIDENT: Gabriel Martinelli crosses the ball into the Liverpool box and then catches Trent Alexander-Arnold on the ankle. The Liverpool defender stays on the ground and requires treatment - and is withdrawn at half-time due to injury. Oliver and VAR choose not to penalise Martinelli for the contact after crossing. DERMOT'S VERDICT: Correct decision. \n              Latest Premier League table \n             \n              Premier League fixtures\n             \n              Premier League results\n             \n              Latest Premier League news\n             DERMOT SAYS: It was checked because I heard them check it. Martinelli crosses the ball and it's just unfortunate. In football, there is physical contact that you don't anticipate and this was the case. A complete accident. INCIDENT: Darwin Nunez scores from Luis Diaz's cross, but the Uruguayan was standing in an offside position for Alexander-Arnold's long ball forward at the start of the move. Nunez does not go for the ball and Gabriel touches the ball into Diaz's path, leaving the Liverpool attacker to cross to Nunez and score. Oliver and VAR say Nunez is not offside at all in the move. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  DERMOT's VERDICT: Correct decision. DERMOT SAYS: They feel Nunez doesn't attempt to get the ball and doesn't impact play because it goes through to Luis Diaz, who crosses and Nunez unfortunately scores. I say unfortunately because he started in an offside position but then Gabriel touches the ball so he is in an onside position so is allowed to continue playing. That's one of the nuances of the offside law. INCIDENT: Diogo Jota crosses into the Arsenal box and the ball strikes Gabriel's arm. Oliver and the linesman on the side choose not to give a penalty and VAR agrees after looking at it. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  DERMOT'S VERDICT: Incorrect decision. DERMOT SAYS: All I can think is that the referee and VAR felt it was too close a proximity. What we've seen this season is if the arm is out - in this case at shoulder height - then it's been penalised. When I saw it and saw the VAR being used, I expected it to be overturned. They felt it was too close, that's why it wasn't given. I anticipated the VAR would recommend a review. All I can think is the VAR felt it was too close so wouldn't recommend it. If he doesn't do that then the referee can't look at the screen. INCIDENT: With Newcastle leading 2-0, Aaron Hickey heads the ball forward onto Dan Burn's arm, with the Magpies defender not looking at the ball in the process. VAR informs referee John Brooks to look at the monitor and a penalty is given. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  DERMOT'S VERDICT: Correct decision DERMOT SAYS: I was surprised the Gabriel one wasn't given. I wasn't surprised this was. The minute I saw it, I thought: 'His arm is up that high and I expect it to be given'. I think they're very similar and I was surprised they weren't treated the same. The directive is if the arm is at shoulder height and above then it's going to be penalised. Dan Burn, I never thought for one second it wouldn't be penalised. INCIDENT: Gianluca Scamacca scores for West Ham to make it 2-1 but Fulham players accuse the Italian of touching the ball with his arm twice in the same move. VAR takes a long look at the two handballs and deems that Scamacca has not deliberately committed an offence. VAR TIME TAKEN: Two minutes and 40 seconds. DERMOT'S VERDICT: The first one is handball, the second is not. DERMOT SAYS: I actually think it touches his hand - and to be fair to the VAR he studied it, studied it and studied it. He looked at it for two minutes and 40 seconds. He checked every single angle and he wasn't convinced it struck the hand. If he's not convinced, he can't give it. I think it touches his hand because of the way the ball travels down. It was a difficult call for the VAR. He didn't look at it and throw it away. Nobody can criticise the VAR for being diligent. The second one is more doubtful, the first one is where it strikes the hand as the trajectory of the ball goes down. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  INCIDENT: Michail Antonio scores West Ham's third goal but is accused of handling the ball in the build-up. The Hammers forward appears to control the ball with his hand, but it is not picked up by the officials and Antonio finishes the move with a goal. DERMOT'S VERDICT: It's handball but VAR can't rule out the goal. DERMOT SAYS: I think it was a handball originally as he swipes at it but because it's not picked up by the referee, it goes on and it doesn't materialise in a goal because Fulham players touch the ball and the play resets. The law says if it strikes his hand, it's got to go directly to a player or his colleague to be penalised. It goes to the same player and that's where it is complicated. If it was picked up on play that it was handball then it's given as a foul, but the VAR deemed it wasn't deliberate handball so he can't penalise it. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  INCIDENT: Marcus Rashford scores what looks like a third goal for Manchester United, but is penalised for controlling the ball with his hand after Everton defender James Tarkowski came in to challenge him. VAR rules the goal out for handball. DERMOT'S VERDICT: Correct decision. DERMOT SAYS: It does strike his hand but he's the only player involved in the move. He scores and it doesn't go to any other player. You can argue that he's still got to go on and score but there's not another player involved. The fact that an Everton player plays it onto him is immaterial. It's about whether it strikes his hand or arm. And it does strike his arm.

I'm sure they'll support him and his family. \"There's much more to football and you have to look at the bigger picture here. The positive is that this has been found before it could have been fatal.

The 37-year-old recorded his latest milestone 20 years and two days after his first ever club goal for Sporting Lisbon in the Portuguese Primeira Liga in 2002. To put his scoring exploits into perspective, Erling Haaland would need to score 37 club goals every season for another 15 years to match Ronaldo's record. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ronaldo has now scored 26 goals since returning to Manchester United last summer, extending his overall tally at the club to 144 - having netted 118 during his first spell at the club. The five-time Ballon D'Or winner joined Real Madrid in 2009 for £80m to end his initial nine-year stay at Old Trafford and proceeded to score 450 goals for the La Liga giants, before joining Juventus in 2018 and scoring 101 goals for the Turin side. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ronaldo's returns have arced during his 20-year career, reaching their peak for Real between 2010/11 and 2015/16, when he scored in excess of 50 goals in six successive seasons - hitting a career-high 61 in 2014/15. That sustained strike rate helped notch 311 goals in La Liga and also helped register a record-breaking 140 in the Champions League as he won the competition with United in 2008 and collected another four winners' medals with Real. \n              Latest Premier League table \n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             \n              Live football on Sky Sports this week\n             A host of La Liga rivals are among his favourite opponents: he smashed a career-topping 27 goals past Sevilla, including a four-goal haul in 2011 and four hat-tricks - while also netting 25 past Real's neighbours Atletico and 20 past El Clasico rivals Barcelona. Ronaldo has been more successful on home soil at his respective clubs, scoring 390 times - compared with 289 on the road and another 21 on neutral territory. Incredibly, the 37-year-old is just two shy of a century of goals struck from outside the box, with 48 of those coming from direct free-kicks - while converting another 129 goals from 12 yards, In total, Ronaldo has scored 460 of his haul with his favoured right boot, but has also found the back of the net 125 times with left-footed finishes and headed home another 113 times. The timing of his goals has remained relatively balanced during games over his career, scoring in almost equal measure across 15-minute periods - understandably scoring more during the closing stages due to second-half stoppage time.

Well-being data released by the PFA on World Mental Health Day highlights the social and mental health challenges current and former professionals face, but also the work the union is doing to help its members. Seventy-nine out of 843 male players in the EFL and Premier League surveyed across the course of last season said they had been bullied at some point in their professional life, while 40 said they had experienced thoughts about taking their own life in the three months prior to completing the survey. Dr Michael Bennett, director of PFA wellbeing, said of the bullying statistics: \"These are stark figures that illustrate how serious these issues are in the game. Based on this feedback, we have adapted the sessions this season to learn more about the type of bullying players face. It could be peer-on-peer bullying, for example, from team-mates in the dressing room or training ground. It could be by club staff or management. \"We are particularly concerned around transfer windows. We know that players can be isolated from their squads when a club is trying to force a move. We are often dealing with cases like this. Ultimately, whether it is the training ground or the stadium on a matchday, it's a player's workplace. They have a right to feel protected and safe at work. It feels obvious to state, but any form of bullying will have a lasting impact on an individual's mental health.\" The data was gathered at well-being workshops held at clubs over the course of the 2021-22 campaign. Some 12 per cent of players (98) said they had felt pressured into getting vaccinated against Covid-19 or felt emotional distress about it, and 22 per cent (189) had experienced severe anxiety, to the point of feeling afraid or that something awful might happen. Dr Bennett added: \"Elite sport can be a highly pressurised and competitive environment. Professional football is a results-based industry, for both players and staff, careers are on the line. Livelihoods are on the line. It's a constant rollercoaster. A bad pass or a missed chance, your confidence goes. Score a goal, and the adrenaline is pumping. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"Players are often at the mercy of a short-term focus and factors outside their control, such as injury, transfer policies, and team selection. Any of which can have a dramatic impact on their long-term career. \"We host well-being workshops at clubs with players of all ages, ranging from the academy to first team. These sessions are vital in creating a secure place to discuss mental health. The data shows that most players will be concerned about at least some aspects of their well-being. These conversations help normalise talking about mental health with the squad.\" The PFA also revealed that 520 members accessed counselling or support services via Sporting Chance last season. Forty-seven per cent were current players, 48 per cent were former players and five per cent were family members of players that the union agreed to support.

But this time it was the other one.  Erling Haaland did score the fourth goal against Saints but it was the performance of Manuel Akanji, a £15m signing from Dortmund on deadline day, that was the focus. Akanji had been asked to play out of position at right-back and made it look very easy indeed. The 27-year-old Switzerland international had already shown his value to City by doing a very good impression of Ruben Dias in the centre of defence against Manchester United. Here he was slipping in seamlessly to replace the injured Kyle Walker instead. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Everyone is beginning to notice just how good Akanji is - not that he will welcome the attention. \"He is very pleased all the [spotlight] is on Erling,\" said Guardiola. \"It is perfect. He is at home with the family. Studying mathematics and these kind of things.\" Those maths skills were showcased in a recent interview with Sky Sports in which Akanji's multiplication ability was challenged. His intelligence is proving more than a quirk. It is helping him to adapt quicker than even Guardiola had anticipated. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"When you are intelligent, obviously I did not know him, but you realise immediately. Carlos [Vicens, the set-pieces coach], he said to me, 'You just tell him once and he knows it'. The movement, defensively and offensively, he trains it and he executes it perfectly. \"This is a gift for a manager. There are players you have to explain things to 10 times and there are players you have to train 10 times what you are thinking or what you want to do. With this guy, we need just one training session just to say things and he has got it.\" \n              Pep jokes 'I'm upset with Erling'\n             \n              Walker has groin surgery\n             \n              Other City players star over Haaland\n             \n              Manchester City fixtures\n             The injury to Walker left many assuming that Joao Cancelo would switch to right-back, just as he did against FC Copenhagen in midweek when Sergio Gomez played at left-back. With John Stones also out, Guardiola looked out of options on the right. Akanji showed against Southampton that this was not the case. \"We are very pleased because now I discovered when we need three at the back, playing right, wow. With the absence of Kyle for a long time and John, I don't know when he will be back, he had this chance at right-back. That he can play there is so important for us.\" Although Guardiola's system is usually described as four at the back, he prefers to build with three. That allows one of the full-backs to push forward. Against Southampton, that was Cancelo with Nathan Ake sliding across to cover. It helped Cancelo score the first goal.  That demands a lot of the right-back because there is still an obligation to provide width on that flank. There was a point during the first half when Akanji found himself with only Haaland ahead of him as he raced away. But the primary task is to cover. \"We thought he could do it,\" said Guardiola. \"It was a little bit scary that we did not play it before. We knew he had to go up the pitch to press and come back, defend the crosses at the far post. He did not miss one. He was absolutely perfect.\" There had been little time for him to prepare. \"The movement that he has to do, the full-back, in our high pressing, he did not train it once and he did it perfectly. That proves again, intelligent person. These people always pay off. So yeah, really, really good.\" Akanji made more tackles than any Manchester City player against Southampton and is averaging more tackles per 90 minutes than anyone else at the club. His one-on-one defending is solid, reflected by the fact that he is yet to be dribbled past in a City shirt. There are other qualities. \"With the ball, he is a magnificent player. We have another weapon on the set pieces, on the long balls, how aggressive he is. With the ball he has composure. A lot of the package, it is perfect. Apart from being an excellent person.\" It is astonishing that City were able to pick up a player of this calibre so late in the transfer window. How did other clubs manage to miss him? \"Listen, in terms of signing players or not signing players, all of us make good things and bad, bad things. You never know.\" The consequences could be significant in the title race. A potential issue has been addressed. \"Nathan and John, unfortunately, sometimes they are not consistent to play every three days. I said for this season we need a striker and a central defender.\" Nobody doubted they had found the striker. Now they know City found both. \"Manu has had a huge impact since he arrived. Again, the club made an incredible signing with him. A real, real, real one and we are very pleased, all of us,\" added Guardiola. \"We are lucky to have him.\" Super 6 is back, bigger and better than ever with a £250,000 jackpot.

The former Real Madrid and Spain goalkeeper posted the update to his 10 million followers on Sunday afternoon. 'Hacked account,' Casillas posted. 'Luckily everything in order. Apologies to all my followers. And of course, more apologies to the LGBT community.' Around 30 minutes earlier, the original post - which read 'I hope you respect me, I'm gay' - had been deleted from the account. Former Barcelona captain Carles Puyol had initially responded to Casillas' tweet. Translated, it read: \"It's time to tell them about us\". But Puyol also subsequently removed his post following Casillas' deletion. Puyol later tweeted an apology, which read: \"I was mistaken. Sorry for a clumsy joke without any bad intentions but absolutely out of place. I understand that it could have hurt feelings. All my respect and support for the LGBTQ+ community.\" A Stonewall Spokesperson said: \"It is disappointing to see homophobic 'jokes' being made at the expense of LGBTQ+ players and fans. Whatever their intent, our words matter. At Stonewall, we'll continue to fight for a better world where LGBTQ+ people can play the sports we love as ourselves.\" Sky Sports News has contacted Twitter to ask if they are, or have been, investigating a hack of Casillas' account. Casillas is considered a legend of Spanish football after being capped 167 for his country and making over 700 appearances for Real Madrid. In May, Blackpool's Jake Daniels became the UK's first male professional footballer to come out publicly as gay since Justin Fashanu in 1990. Josh Cavallo, who last year became the first openly gay active player in men's professional football, described the incident between Casillas and Puyol as \"disappointing\". \"Iker Casillas and Carles Puyol joking and making fun out of coming out in football is disappointing,\" Cavallo said on Twitter. \"It's a difficult journey that any LGBTQ+ ppl have to go through. To see my role models and legends of the game make fun out of coming out and my community is beyond disrespectful.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News reporter Mark McAdam: \"One tweet, six words, 32 characters and so much damage has been done, with all the good work going on behind the scenes. \"If you look at the last 12 months, we saw Josh Cavallo come out in Australia, we have seen young Jake Daniels come out in the EFL, and then most recently Zander Murray in Scotland, which shows football is progressing. \"There is some brilliant work going on and change is genuinely being made, but when a tweet like this comes out and you've got two of the most high-profile Spanish footballers almost mocking gay people where, at the moment, it is illegal to be gay in 69 countries, young children are committing suicide because of their sexuality and there are people who are being murdered because of their sexuality, this is not a laughing matter. \"This is not a joke and it is not a source of comedy and entertainment for these footballers, regardless of the hacking situation. \"This is really serious, and it has set things back, but what you have seen from the three players I mentioned (Cavallo, Daniels, Murray) is that there is a place for LGBTQ + people in football and progress is really being made. \"This could have been one of those moments that completely changed football for the better where someone decided to say 'look, I'm gay and I'm happy to talk about it and I'm happy to put it out there'. \"But obviously it wasn't that moment because every time someone comes out, every time you've got people talking about this stuff it makes young LGBTQ +people around the world feel a little bit safer, a little bit more accepted in themselves. \"They look up to their idols and say 'if they can be gay and be a footballer then it makes me accept myself that little bit more' and that's the key for all the campaigns that happen. \"It's about showing football is an inclusive place, that progress is being made, and that you can be yourself and still enjoy football and sport as much as anyone else. \"This is why these situations are so damaging.

Each time they've responded to win. Previously they had to come from behind against Fulham at the Emirates, while in their first game here this season, Leicester twice threatened to get back into the match and were twice put back in their place. For all the brilliant attacking play of this Arsenal team, it is their resolve which stands out. Their opening-minute goal against Liverpool was stunning but their second on the stroke of half-time, after Liverpool had claimed control of the contest, was crucial. They didn't allow Roberto Firmino's goal early in the second half to derail the momentum they'd found. Arteta talked up the spirit and atmosphere generated by the Arsenal supporters. \"I've never seen it like this,\" he said afterwards. \"You can not imagine how much it helps the players.\" There is certainly a different feeling around the ground this year. There's belief at Arsenal. Whatever the setback they have the confidence they'll come back. It's taken them to the top of the Premier League table - and could take them a long way this season.Peter Smith  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"We're not in the title race.\" Few would argue with Jurgen Klopp's assessment after Sunday's 3-2 defeat at Arsenal left Liverpool 14 points off the leaders, and 13 adrift of champions Manchester City, just eight games into the season. The devil is, of course, in the detail, and Klopp's carefully-phrased post-match analysis left the door open to the prospect of Liverpool rising out of this early-season slump and back into contention at a later date. \n              Latest Premier League table \n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             \n              Premier League fixtures\n             Question is: if Liverpool are not in the title race at present, is there anything to suggest they can force themselves back into the picture? Their setback at the Emirates would suggest not. Klopp has tinkered with his team in a bid to increase Liverpool's defensive surety and yet it took all of 58 seconds for Gabriel Martinelli to open the scoring - the 10th time the Reds have conceded first in their last 12 Premier League games. Liverpool have not turned into a bad side overnight, and there were glimpses of the swashbuckling team of old, notably how they twice hauled themselves back on level terms, but in the championship rounds of Sunday's absorbing contest they were found wanting, with their famous high-press, high-octane style of football noticeably absent when the time came to mount a late onslaught. With their defeat compounded by injuries to Trent Alexander-Arnold and Luis Diaz, the time needed to regroup may come too late to salvage their fading title chances, which will surely be extinguished once and for all if Manchester City leave Anfield with a victory next Sunday.Jack Wilkinson Casemiro has had to wait for his first Premier League start. He first came off the bench in August but after four substitute appearances, here he was in the starting line-up. He helped make the difference in the end but only after some difficult moments at Everton. Bundled off the ball in the build-up to Alex Iwobi's opening goal, he also surrendered possession before what turned out to be Manchester United's winner. Fortunately, he quickly retrieved it before measuring his pass through for Cristiano Ronaldo to score. The Brazilian has produced more convincing performances in his long and distinguished career but this was as an important one for his new manager Erik ten Hag because it hinted at the greater stability that he might provide when he is fully up to speed. Casemiro made four tackles in the game at Goodison Park - twice as many as anyone else on the pitch. That ability to provide a defensive screen ahead of the defence will be crucial if Ten Hag is to succeed. Passes such as the one for Ronaldo's winner? They will help too.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Everton entered the tie boasting the best defensive record in the Premier League but were undone all too easily by a familiar foe, with Goodison Park shrouded in misplaced hope. They conceded as many goals against Man United as they had done in their first four home games combined. Dreams of a third clean sheet of the campaign dashed by high-flying Antony after only 15 minutes. History will tell you that Everton regularly struggle against their northwest rivals. They've conceded a total of 51 times in top-flight competition against United at home - the first opponent they have shipped 50+ goals against at Goodison. It was a reality check. Progress has been made under Frank Lampard, no doubt about that, but Everton are by no means the finished article. Their display against Erik ten Hag's side can be characterised by two issues: high possession turnover and a lack of potency in attack. They lost the ball carelessly, in dangerous areas, twice leading to goals. Mistakes that cost points. While the Man United goalmouth enjoyed a relatively pressure-free evening, bar a wonder strike from Alex Iwobi that caught David de Gea unsighted. \"We have been moving in the right direction and we just get checked,\" Lampard conceded after full-time. The hosts retreated deep too cheaply, and too often, gifting United free territory. They were tentative and frightened to press. \"The tactical application of the team I wasn't in love with,\" their manager summarised. In truth, there wasn't a lot to love about the display, bar the late reintroduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin - back from injury. That should apprehend some of Everton's attacking woe, but won't solve every problem. Much more is needed from Anthony Gordon, Demarai Gray and Neal Maupay to ensure early-season promise doesn't peter into a mid-season slump.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leeds managed to be drawing a match at half-time that looked to be heading only one way - and then ended up losing it, not for the first time. Jesse Marsch's side dominated at Selhurst Park in the first half yet managed to concede from Crystal Palace's only attempt on target. Their inability to be ahead at the break having not made more of their pressure ultimately cost them three points. Since the start of last season, only Leicester (23) have dropped more points from winning positions than Leeds (15) away from home in the Premier League. Marsch may have a talented young squad but they need to learn fast how to manage games better and become more street-wise. \"When you play teams in this league, they're so clever and the players are very experienced, they know what the games require,\" he said, alluding to Leeds' slack in-game management. When Palace started to play more direct in the second half to bypass the visitors' press, Leeds did not come up with any answers. Their substitutes made no impact in stopping Palace from grabbing the inevitable winner. It's time for Leeds to grow up.David Richardson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Eberechi Eze made his return from the nasty Achilles injury he suffered in May 2021 last November but it has taken until the start of this season for the 24-year-old to finally return to something approaching his best form. It's hard to blame Eze for that, given the seriousness of the injury he suffered and the fact that, when he returned to fitness, Palace had changed managers and he had a number of new team-mates from which to win back his starting place. But Patrick Vieira has never seemed to doubt the talent Eze has at his disposal, with the manager easing him back into the starting XI at the end of last season and then handing him a regular berth this campaign. Vieira has been rewarded for that patience, with Eze now back to dazzling opponents and fans alike with the skill he so often showed during his debut campaign at Selhurst Park after arriving from QPR. But Vieira is also being rewarded for a tactical switch, with his decision to deploy Eze - previously used as a winger or No 10 - as part of a midfield three paying dividends. The move is allowing Eze to use his undoubted technical skill to exert more influence on games, as shown by him ranking second for touches and accurate passes among all players in Palace's win over Leeds. Vieira spoke after the game about how Eze has yet more potential to unlock and how the key to doing so is for the former England U21 international to effect games more in the final third. Eze certainly showed he is capable of doing that against Leeds, with his 16 final-third passes the most among all Palace players and his brilliant goal coming after he ventured towards the opposition area to exchange passes with Zaha. For so long the attacking burden has often fallen on Zaha but, with Eze finding his feet again and being encouraged to play further forward, the Palace crowd favourite may have a team-mate to help share the load.Joe Shread Then it went click. That was the sound emanating from the London Stadium as Gianluca Scamacca and Lucas Paqueta started a partnership that could be about to take the Premier League by storm. West Ham splashed over £85m for the pair over the summer but David Moyes has been careful not to overload both players as they adapt to their new surroundings and a different type of football. It was a move criticised by some parts of a fanbase that were desperate to see their big-money purchases in action. However, Moyes - with all his experience - knows the game better than most and this slowly, slowly approach to both players is now delivering rewards. Scamacca and Paqueta were a class apart in the 3-1 win over Fulham. Moyes unleashed Paqueta in a free role off the striker - a position a player of his silk and savviness is going to enjoy greatly. He floated around the pitch like a man in his element. Scamacca was the beneficiary of his service but could not take advantage of the supply in the first half, pulling a shot wide after a Paqueta pass down the line and heading an even better chance straight at Bernd Leno - again from some majestic wide play from the Brazilian. Scamacca did not need a third invite to come to the party though and finally he gave Paqueta the assist his play deserved by looping home the contentious winner. Premier League defences beware.Lewis Jones Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"We had a chat in the managers' meeting to say you couldn't put two arms round the player. It was a stonewall penalty, it was more of an American Football challenge,\" David Moyes said afterwards. For Fulham's Andreas Pereira, the message wasn't clear enough. Not from his manager in the summer, and certainly still not after three separate conversations with referee Chris Kavanagh as West Ham were handed a route back following a groggy start. Pereira was booked, and so too was Marco Silva following Scamacca's controversial winner. In fear of being fined, Silva refused to speak on the game's major incidents but his team could ultimately have few complaints. Up until Jarrod Bowen's equaliser, Fulham had been the better side - as Silva pointed out - but they offered very little after Dan James had struck the crossbar quarter of an hour in. The question mark hanging over his players before kick-off was to what degree Aleksandar Mitrovic would be missed but their encouraging start evaporated to leave that topic still lingering. With Bournemouth and Aston Villa next at Craven Cottage, it is precisely this run of fixtures where the club's talisman is needed to make the difference. Fulham remain winless in their last 16 London derbies in the Premier League away from home, losing all three this season and only collecting three draws in that run. The Serbian's return cannot come soon enough.Ben Grounds Super 6 is back, bigger and better than ever with a £250,000 jackpot.

It was announced on Thursday morning that Ventrone, who was nicknamed 'The Marine' for his intense fitness sessions, had passed away at the age of 61 following a short battle with leukemia. Tottenham paid tribute to the Italian coach by wearing a tribute shirt to Ventrone before their match at Brighton on Saturday, with captain Hugo Lloris holding up a shirt with 'Gian Piero' on the back in front of the travelling fans at the end of the game. Tottenham head coach Conte, who was emotional after a minute's applause for Ventrone moments before kick-off on the south coast, revealed that he will be attending Ventrone's funeral on Sunday and that the players were \"devastated\" by the news that Ventrone had passed. \"Tomorrow is the funeral. We are going with the staff,\" said Conte. \"I want to give big hugs to them [the family], to tell his son and daughter that they need to be strong because Gian Piero was strong, a strong character. He doesn't want to see us unhappy. It's difficult to make him happy because we are really devastated by the pain. \"I have to be honest, it was really, really difficult for us to be here and to focus on the game because what happened in the last three days was incredible. I knew that the situation was really problematic after the game against Frankfurt [on Wednesday] but no one could have expected this situation because no one knew. \"It was an illness but under control and then it is very difficult because the situation hit me a lot in the emotional aspect. When it happens, it is very difficult to cover your feeling with the players and with the people that work in Tottenham. At the same time, I have seen a lot of solidarity. \"The players were really devastated by the pain and the whole Tottenham environment, the feeling was really bad because in only 10 months I think Gian Piero got through the heart of everybody.\" Ventrone arrived at Spurs with Antonio Conte in November 2021. The fitness coach was at Juventus from 1994 to 2004 - during which time Conte played for Juventus - working under Marcelo Lippi and Carlo Ancelotti. The fitness coach was also part of Lippi's staff when Italy won the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He has also worked for French club AC Ajaccio, Italian side Catania and in China for JS Suning and Guangzhou. The Italian oversaw a complete overhaul of Tottenham's fitness, with Conte's side having ran more than any other team in the Premier League this season. Conte said that the last time he spoke to Ventrone was \"last week on Thursday\" when he asked to be excused from training due to illness. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player   Tottenham striker Harry Kane celebrated his winning goal by pointing to the sky in tribute to Ventrone in what was an emotional occasion. \"It's been a difficult week and it was nice to get the win,\" said Kane, who was holding back the tears at full-time. When asked if the performance was for Ventrone, man-of-the-match Ryan Sessegnon said: \"Yes, 100 per cent. \"We knew we had to perform today and obviously we wanted to win because of him, and thankfully we did that.\" Before the game, Tottenham's players warmed up in shirts with the words 'Always in our hearts, Gian Piero'. Sky Sports' Lewis Jones at the Amex: \"It's hard for onlookers who had no foot in the Tottenham camp to understand truly just how much the staff has been hit by the sudden death of popular fitness coach Gian Piero Ventrone. We can gauge the clear sadness from the tributes posted online by the players and, of course, the clear holding back of tears by Harry Kane when interviewed after the game. But it's hard to truly feel it from a personal standpoint. \"Yet, a moment did hit me quite hard. It was hard not to get emotional walking down the steps from the press box at The Amex, long after the final whistle had gone and witness the Spurs substitutes doing their warm-down. To the backdrop of an empty stadium, the players were undertaking their first post-match fitness duties since the passing of their guru. \"A part of the puzzle missing. Gone. There was an eerie silence as the nine substitutes were put through their paces by two members of the coaching staff. He no doubt would have been proud of Tottenham's performance. \"The man nicknamed 'The Marine' because of his rigorous training regimes would have liked what he saw. \"A fitting tribute, indeed.\" Super 6 is back, bigger and better than ever with a £250,000 jackpot.

Modeste, under massive criticism after having scored just once in the league following his arrival this season to replace ailing Sebastien Haller, headed in at the far post with the last touch of the game after also setting up their first goal, to rescue a point for his team and keep Bayern off top spot. Leon Goretzka had fired the visitors in front in the 33rd minute before Leroy Sane added another in the 53rd in the high-intensity encounter in front of a sold-out 81,000 crowd at the Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund. Youssoufa Moukoko cut the deficit in the 74th minute to become the youngest scorer in the history of Der Klassiker at 17-years-old as Bayern ended the game with 10 men after Kingsley Coman was sent off in the 90th minute with a second booking. The Bavarians, who face Viktoria Plzen in the Champions League on Wednesday, are on 16 points as many as Dortmund, with Union Berlin and Freiburg, both on 17, in action on Sunday. Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso made a winning start in his first game as Bayer Leverkusen manager as Moussa Diaby scored once and set up two more goals for Jeremie Frimpong in a 4-0 demolition of visiting Schalke. Diaby, who netted 13 times in the previous campaign but had yet to score this season, thundered in a shot from 22 metres in the 38th minute before setting up Frimpong to drill in from a tight angle three minutes later. \n              Bundesliga results\n             \n              La Liga results\n             \n              Ligue 1 results\n             \n              Serie A results\n             The pair combined again eight minutes after the restart with Diaby, who was linked with a move to Newcastle in the summer, again the provider and Dutch midfielder Frimpong slotting in from close range for his fourth goal of the season. Paulinho completed the rout with a well-timed run in the 90th to give Alonso, the former Spain international who replaced Gerardo Seoane on the bench earlier this week, a dream start. Their second league win of the campaign lifted Leverkusen, who host Porto in the Champions League on Wednesday, off the bottom spots and into 14th on eight points. Promoted Schalke dropped to 16th on six. AC Milan secured a 2-0 win over struggling rivals Juventus with goals from England defender Fikayo Tomori and midfielder Brahim Diaz in a spirited Serie A clash at the San Siro. Defending champions Milan provisionally moved up two places to third in the standings on 20 points, level with leaders Napoli and second-placed Atalanta who both have a game in hand. Juventus, who appeared to have turned a corner after beating Bologna 3-0 at home last weekend, following that up with a 3-1 victory against Maccabi Haifa in the Champions League in midweek, remain eighth on 13 points. Milan were determined to make up for Wednesday's 3-0 defeat to Chelsea in the Champions League and they made it 1-0 just before the break through Tomori who followed up a shot by Olivier Giroud and rifled the ball into the roof of the net. Diaz then doubled Milan's lead one minute later when he took advantage of Dusan Vlahovic's mistake and raced towards Juve's goal, finishing off a solo effort with a brilliant strike. Juve's away form continues to trouble coach Massimiliano Allegri, whose side last won on the road in late April. They have only picked up two points in four Serie A away matches this season and face a testing trip to Maccabi Haifa in midweek. Both sides return to Champions League action on Tuesday before Juventus travel to Torino for the derby next Saturday, while Milan visit Verona on Sunday. Eder Militao's early header gave Real Madrid a low-key 1-0 win at Getafe to move them back to the top of LaLiga. Real moved on to 22 points, three ahead of rivals Barcelona, who have a game in hand and will host Celta Vigo on Sunday. Militao scored the winner in the third minute, ghosting between several defenders to head home from close-range from a corner by Luka Modric. Getafe have lost two straight games and are 16th on seven points, two above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Angel Correa scored twice as Atletico Madrid won 2-1 against Girona. Girona made it difficult for the home side who relied on an inspired performance from Jan Oblak and got lucky when two second-half strikes from the visitors hit the post. Both Correa's goals were scored in the early minutes of each half. The Argentinian stroked in a close-range, first-time shot from an Antoine Griezmann cross to open the scoring after five minutes. It was Atletico's second consecutive La Liga win as they looked to rebound from their Champions League loss to Club Brugge on Tuesday. They will face the Belgian side again in Madrid on Wednesday, with Atletico sitting last in Group B on three points, six behind the Belgians who are top. Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain played more than one half with 10 men but salvaged a goalless draw at Stade de Reims to extend their unbeaten run this season. Sergio Ramos picked up a straight red card as tempers flared shortly before half-time but a reshuffled PSG, in the absence of the injured Lionel Messi, managed to keep a clean sheet. They have 26 points from 10 games and lead Marseille, who slumped to a 2-1 home defeat by AC Ajaccio, by three points. Reims are 14th on eight points. Third-placed Lorient will leapfrog Marseille into second place if they beat Brest and fourth-placed RC Lens will also move ahead if they grab all three points in the northern derby at Lille on Sunday.

Josh Sargent put the Canaries in front two minutes in but Preston, who had only scored four goals in their first 12 matches, equalised through Emil Riis and the forward fired the Lilywhites into the lead with his second of the game just after the break. Norwich then levelled through Gabriel Sara, with his first goal for the club, but Parrott netted 10 minutes from time to move Preston up into eighth.

Chris Forino's first-half headed goal earned Wycombe a 1-0 win at Oxford in a game which was delayed by 45 minutes due to a medical emergency in the crowd.

Sheffield Wednesday reignited their push for promotion back to the Championship with a 3-0 win over Cheltenham.

We showed ourselves that we can do it and that brings confidence. \"We have ten months [until the World Cup], we have next Tuesday [against the Czech Republic], then the November camp and the Arnold Clark Cup in April. \"We took this moment to take another starting point to really see where we are and then we take it from there. We're going to try and add some more things to our game. We're already in a pretty good place, but we need to improve a few things that we do already, but also want to add some things and see some more players too.\" As much as England were able to judge where they are, a young USA side also gained experience from facing the European champions as they prepare for their title defence in ten months' time. USA coach Andonovski was looking to create conditions his team will face in Australia and New Zealand, and praised the Lionesses as a team, plus the match overall at Wembley. \"It was a great event. Great for women's football. I thought that the fans that came did an incredible job and I want to thank them for supporting. This game was a big game, but it was not a World Cup final. At World Cup finals a lot of people show up. But we've never seen a friendly game that has been supported as well. \"I thought tonight the fans made a statement. It was a great night. A very exciting game. Everything we expected from the opponent we pretty much saw it. They were very well organised, physical. They are obviously well-coached. \"That's why we came here, to experience that. We have a fairly young squad that needed to experience this. They need to go through tough moments and hopefully learn from them. \"This game is important for preparation for the World Cup. There is a reason we played it so far out.

It checked all the boxes, not we need to get back to the drawing board. \"I absolutely believe [that they have a chance of winning the World Cup]. They have an incredible squad. They showed once again that they are very good. If you give them a little space they have players than can make a difference. They have an incredible coach, she has done a good job. I wouldn't mind facing them in the final again.\" Sky Sports' Laura Hunter: \"It wasn't perfect, but there is reason for cautious optimism following England's latest conquest. The psychological edge that comes with beating such a powerhouse is alone a tangible triumph. Sarina Wiegman's remarkable unbeaten run as manager lives on. Lionesses fans will hope that it never ends. \"US head coach Vlatko Andonovski was quoted as saying he \"wouldn't mind meeting [England] again in the final.\" He was referring to the World Cup final.

But more than that, England are commanding acclaim based on the consistency of their delivery. They are a different animal under Wiegman. Ruthless, but also immensely difficult to beat. \"Even without captain Leah Williamson and chief goal threat Alessia Russo, they managed to find a way to overcome the USA. It was the first time they've managed it since 2017 - and only their third time ever in 19 attempts. The gap has certainly closed. Some may argue that it no longer exists. \"Needless to say, it was a poignant night for women's football in a game that represented more than just 22 players on a pitch. The Lionesses rightly demonstrated their solidarity with the USA squad by wearing teal armbands, while also posing with a banner that read \"protect the players\" before kick-off.

In the build-up to this game, he was asked about a light-hearted petition to stop him playing in the Premier League. Even the club stuck him on the front page of the programme for this one. Twenty goals in 13 games will do that, but this afternoon was a little different. Erling Haaland had hit the post from a one-on-one chance with the game goalless, missed his kick when it seemed easy to side-foot in and then failed to take the ball around the goalkeeper. The supporters seemed a little bemused by it, so accustomed have they become to seeing him score. But it highlighted the fact that even while Haaland dominates defenders and the media coverage, there is so much more to this side - and we saw that against Southampton. Joao Cancelo was the best player on the pitch, while Phil Foden rivalled in until being withdrawn just before the hour mark. Kevin De Bruyne was magnificent. Manuel Akanji, playing out of position at right-back, has been a revelation since his own move from Borussia Dortmund. Even Haaland's goal highlighted that this is a team effort. There were 21 passes in the build-up to it - no goal has featured a longer passing sequence in the Premier League this season. The fascination with Haaland remains. But this is a formidable Manchester City team.Adam Bate Manchester City failed to beat Southampton home and away last season so maybe this should not have been the foregone conclusion. Yet, the gulf between the two teams was apparent from the start.

I think we were not at the level on the ball.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Austrian did go on to explain why the presence of Erling Haaland creates new problems but Southampton created plenty for themselves, turning over the ball in bad areas. They are still trying to be a pressing team but they look less confident than ever in possession. That win over Chelsea in which the now injured Romeo Lavia starred feels a long time ago now. Four defeats have followed and though they remain outside of the relegation zone, the trajectory for this young team is worrying. It is West Ham next. It feels huge.Adam Bate It's hard for onlooker who has no foot in the Tottenham camp to understand truly just how much the staff has been hit by the sudden death of popular fitness coach Gian Piero Ventrone. We can gauge the clear sadness from the tributes posted online by the players and of course the clear holding back of tears by Harry Kane when interviewed after the game. But it's hard to truly feel it from a personal standpoint. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Yet, a moment did hit me quite hard. It was hard not to get emotional walking down the steps from the press box at the Amex, long after the final whistle had gone and witness the Spurs substitutes doing their warm down. To the backdrop of an empty stadium, the players were undertaking their first post-match fitness duties since the passing of their guru. A part of the puzzle missing. Gone. There was an eerie silence as the nine substitutes were put through their paces by two members of the coaching staff. Ventrone would have certainly been proud of Tottenham's performance. It was one where the fitness built up under Ventrone's watch was used to maximum effect as Spurs battled and ran hard to repel Brighton despite this being their third game in seven days.

A fitting tribute, indeed.Lewis Jones It was suggested at points last season that while Manchester City and Liverpool had the best teams, Chelsea had the best squad. That was not always evident during the previous campaign but their strength in depth was plain to see on Saturday, as a much-changed line-up swept aside Wolves. The visitors have their own problems, with injuries and suspensions leaving them leaning on an ageing Diego Costa to lead the line and youngsters sent from the bench when they were looking to come back into the game. But the gulf to the quality Graham Potter could call upon was enormous. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There were seven changes from the midweek crushing of Serie A title holders AC Milan in the Champions League but even with Wesley Fofana injured, Thiago Silva nursing a cold and Reece James, Ben Chilwell and Raheem Sterling invited to rest up in the dugout, Chelsea clicked from the first whistle. The incoming Conor Gallagher was excellent, while Trevoh Chalobah did not drop a beat on his first start of the season, and Cesar Azpilicueta was at his reliable best at right wing-back. Rather than suffer without the game-to-game rhythm, the likes of Jorginho looked refreshed by the rotation. Potter made it clear in his post-match press conference that getting that balance of minutes right is crucial, both for the success on the pitch and the morale in the dressing room. But it appears right now he has a whole squad of players singing from the same hymn sheet and relishing their moments on the field. During a long, draining season it could be Chelsea's biggest weapon.Peter Smith Diego Costa had not started a competitive football match since December of last year before Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge so you cannot blame him for looking a bit rusty. But he will certainly need to do more in future if he is to revitalise this woeful Wolves attack. A measly nine touches, most of which were clumsy, is a sorry return on his Chelsea homecoming. Once such a threat at Stamford Bridge, Costa looked a shadow of his former self. He also had one unsuccessful dribble, five failed duels and gave up possession on four occasions. There was, however, a glimpse of Costa's threat when he almost found Matheus Nunes with a cross in a dangerous area in the first half, only for Conor Gallagher to provide a crucial interception for Chelsea. Wolves' struggles in the final third have been well documented - three goals in nine games is a league low - and it would be harsh to put all the blame at Costa's door. He did, though, look miles off it at Stamford Bridge. Had it been a different story, he may not have received such a warm reception from the Chelsea faithful when subbed off in the second half. Costa milked the standing ovation by taking the long route back to the bench slowly as he soaked up the chants of, 'Diego, Diego, Diego', stopping for a high-five or two along the way. If Wolves are to get themselves out of the relegation zone Costa must rediscover some of the form that helped him become such a fan favourite at Stamford Bridge.Zinny Boswell Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  How long can Leicester go on performing like this? Five away Premier League defeats to start the new campaign and 19 goals conceded. The Foxes have now dropped 30 points from winning positions in 2022 - 13 more than anyone else in the Premier League. It's unthinkable. They invited the pressure onto themselves here - architects of their own downfall, as Rodgers himself eluded to afterwards. There was no bravery but plenty of backward passes. Too safe. You could make excuses for them to some degree during a wretched run of fixtures which has seen them face five of the top six, but not for this. On the evidence at Bournemouth, Leicester are not in a false position because without leadership in this league, away venues can be a very lonely place. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The last time Leicester lost a Premier League game when winning at half-time was here at Bournemouth in July 2020, when they ended up being thumped 4-1. Not long after, Bournemouth were relegated but it was a defeat which came a hammer blow to the Foxes' hopes of clawing a Champions League berth. There is plenty of games left but Leicester are in a fight of a different kind at this stage. How times have changed.Ben Grounds Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Bournemouth deserve due credit for the manner in which they dug this out. Ryan Christie was the match-winner for Rodgers as Celtic lifted the 2018 Scottish League Cup, the last of his seven trophies at the club. The Leicester boss knew all about his ability, and having been recalled to Bournemouth's starting line-up here by O'Neil, he repaid his manager's faith with a lively showing that was capped with a confident finish. It felt like it would be another case of there being no lack of endeavour but no end product from the hosts but like London buses, two goals came along at once. Virtually everyone Bournemouth as nailed on to go down but they continue to confound their critics. The Cherries sit eighth. Unbeaten in five Premier League games, there is not the same crippling lack of consistency seen in Leicester. O'Neil has shown good in-game management, too, making a tactical alteration at half-time against Nottingham Forest to turn a 2-0 loss into a memorable 3-2 victory and here he influenced proceedings by moving to a back five once Christie had nudged them in front. Leicester never looked like recovering. \"It's an incredible group and it's a privilege to work with them,\" O'Neil said afterwards. Surely it is now only a matter of time before he is given the chance to lead them on a permanent basis.Ben Grounds Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Bruno Guimaraes quickly became a fan favourite at St James' Park after arriving from Lyon in the middle of last season and it's not hard to see why. Since he made his Premier League debut in February, no Newcastle player has scored more than his seven goals from midfield - a clear indication of his importance to Eddie Howe's impressive side. Against Brentford, Guimaraes' two goals stole the show but he produced an all-round performance, leading from the front with and without the ball. Only Kieran Trippier - who also produced another outstanding performance from right-back - had more touches of the ball among Newcastle's players, while Guimaraes' 43 accurate passes led the way for his team. Guimaraes was also a thorn in Brentford's side when they were able to take the ball off him. Apart from Sven Botman - who is finally making a spot in Newcastle's defence his own - no player on either side won possession on more occasions or won more duels than the Brazilian. While £40m is far from an insignificant sum, Newcastle will view the fee they paid for Guimaraes earlier this year as a bargain, given he has been at the heart of so much of the progress the club have made on the field following the Saudi-backed takeover a year ago.Joe Shread Brentford's afternoon appeared to have started perfectly when Bryan Mbeumo drilled them into an early lead at Newcastle but the decision to rule out the goal was the beginning of the end for Thomas Frank's side. The Bees boss could have chosen to have drawn attention to the call after the game, given the player penalised was Ivan Toney, who did not touch the ball as it found its way to Mbeumo. But, despite admitting how hard it was to digest the heavy defeat his side had just suffered, Frank did not just refuse to criticise the officials but instead backed their decision. The honesty was admirable from Frank, who was true to his name when it came to assessing the performances of his players in their 5-1 defeat at Newcastle. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Brentford gave the hosts a helping hand with four of their strikes, according to the head coach, who may be becoming concerned with the amount of goals his side are conceding. While they have scored just once in their last three games, the Londoners have conceded eight in that period. In total, Frank's side have now conceded 17 goals in just nine Premier League games. Only 20th-placed Nottingham Forest, 19th-placed Leicester and Bournemouth, who have a 9-0 defeat to Liverpool on their resume, have conceded more than Brentford. It's certainly not time for the Bees to panic, given they are 12th and have winnable games against Brighton - live on Sky Sports - Aston Villa, Wolves and Nottingham Forest coming up. However, Frank's side are leaking goals and have just one win in their last six games. It can be presumed the boss will be handing out some of his trademark honesty to his players.Joe Shread Super 6 is back, bigger and better than ever with a £250,000 jackpot.

Schumacher said: \"It's been a great month.

She said: \"Players have lots of things to think about on a game day. \"Removing anxiety around what they are wearing and how their period might impact on that. Players will change tampons and change different items around their periods really regularly because of the concerns.\" While the women at West Brom are making this change, this is not a conversation that is unique to this club or to this sport. The Lionesses take on the USA later on Friday at Wembley and while they say they like playing in an all-white kit, they contacted kit manufacturer Nike with feedback that when it comes to your time of the month, playing in white is just not practical. England wore the all-white kit during last summer's successful European Championship campaign and after England's 1-0 win over Austria in their opening game, forward Beth Mead revealed they had given their feedback to Nike regarding their concerns over wearing white shorts. The Arsenal forward said: \"That is something we have fed to Nike. I think hopefully they are going to change that. \"It is very nice to have an all-white kit but sometimes it's not practical when it's the time of the month. \"We have discussed it as a team and we have fed that back to Nike.\" They were comments that were backed up by team-mate Georgia Stanway, who said: \"I think next year there is potentially [going to be] a colour change. \"It's hard because once you're on the grass, nothing else matters.\" Speaking after West Brom's decision to change to navy shorts, Chloe Kelly, who scored the Lionesses winning goal against Germany in the final of the European Championship last summer, says the fact people are now listening is a huge turning point for women's sport. She said: \"You want to be comfortable to be at your best and I think it's a huge turning point for women's sport that people are listening to us. \"For females to be comfortable doing what we are doing is massive.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When the Lionesses won the Euros last summer it put women's sport on a stage that many had not seen before. Some experts say we shouldn't be fooled, though, as their success doesn't mean the system is working for women. \"People believe that because we are into women's bodies, we know how they work and how to get the best out of them, and actually, we don't,\" The Well HQ's Dr Emma Ross told Sky Sports News. \"So, educating girls, even on their pathway to being elite footballers, about how their menstrual cycle can impact them for better or for worse, how to get the right sports bra and all of those things, are so important for getting the best out of their bodies and not letting their bodies hold them back.\" As women's sport continues to grow and our sportswomen across all sports enjoy a bigger platform, it is hoped conversations like this will become the norm. It's only right that whether they are winning like the Lionesses or not, sportswomen can enjoy a greater say in what they have to wear.

Cooper's position was reportedly under pressure with Forest bottom of the Premier League after eight games, but the club have decided to put their faith in the former Swansea boss. Forest also appointed Filippo Giraldi as their new sporting director earlier this week. \"Everyone who knows me knows how much I have loved and am loving my time at Nottingham Forest, and knows how important it is to me,\" Cooper said at his press conference on Friday ahead of Monday's game against Aston Villa on Monday Night Football. \"I'm not much of a media follower, so I've not been as informed about what's been said [this week] as anyone else, but internally there's only been normal conversations after Monday's game. \"We were obviously disappointed with the result and performance, but the conversations with ownership and the CEO have just been about that - but that's like it is after every game. My mindset is on my job, being the head coach of the club.\" Cooper guided Forest to promotion from the Championship through the play-offs last season, but has overseen a complete makeover of the squad over the summer with 23 signings arriving. \n              Latest Premier League table \n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             \n              Live football on Sky Sports this week\n             After claiming four points from their opening three games, Forest's new-look side have lost five games in a row. A 4-0 defeat at rivals Leicester on Monday has left them bottom of the table. Asked if he thought he was in danger of losing his job, he said: \"I don't know how close that might have been. \"Whether it was discussed, I don't know.

But, at the moment, we are and I keep saying stick to what you believe in.\" Cooper was previously coy about his contract situation and even as recently as last week insisted he was not bothered by it. But he revealed that talks have been going on in the background for some time and the new deal is not a result of this week's speculation. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"That hasn't happened this week. We spoke after the game, as usual,\" he said. \"I have to say the conversations I have with the ownership and with Dane (Murphy, chief executive), they have always been a discussion, rather than one person talking. \"This is just normal. We were all really disappointed after Monday. Me, first of all. But so were they. We talk about what went wrong in the game, what went right. I am always the first one to say, 'we should have done that better'. \"But don't think that it has been along the lines of, 'let's start the process now of negotiating a contract' on Tuesday morning. It has been something that has happened over a long while. \"I have had conversations with the hierarchy in the last few days. But they were just normal conversations.\" Sky Sports' Adam Smith Forest sit rock bottom of the league table with four points from eight games and a goal difference of -15. Leicester have the third-worst differential with -8, and the Foxes thrashed Forest 4-0 on Monday. So it might come as a surprise Forest tied Cooper down with a three-year extension when there was growing speculation suggesting the club could pull the trigger on him. Most promoted sides would be expected to be among the relegation places, but the £157.3m summer spending spree has heaped added pressure on the manager to deliver - with his outlay surpassed only by Chelsea, Manchester United, West Ham and Tottenham. In fact, Forest's spending sets a new record for summer transfer expenditure after winning promotion to the Premier League - surpassing Aston Villa's £152.7m splurge in 2019/20. The graphic below lists each promoted club's outlay since 1995/96 and reveals a link between investment and survival come the end of the season - with eight out of nine previous teams to have spent in excess of £49m retaining top-tier status come May. Indeed, all of those eight teams registered 35 points or more, with Leeds clocking 59 after a £106m summer spend in 2020/21, but Ipswich actually hold the record for the most points won in the Premier League after promotion - shelling out £8.6m and winning 66 points in 2000/01. So while evidence suggests Forest's investment should secure survival, the club needed to sign players on permanent contracts to replace a raft of expired loan deals. In addition, Forest's overhaul of 23 new recruits was unprecedented. The previous record for a promoted club was 14 signings, set by Norwich in 2021/22. Arguably, the unsettling overhaul and financial outlay have been mitigated by the necessity to do so, and Cooper reiterated the need to bed his recruits in after the bruising defeat at the King Power - and it appears the club's hierarchy agree.

The midfielder was forced off during Wednesday night's Champions League defeat to RB Leipzig in Germany and, after seeing a specialist on Friday, has had his fears realised with the news that he will not play any competitive football for the best part of three months at least. He would have missed Celtic's game at St Johnstone on Saturday, live on Sky Sports, through suspension anyway but will now miss a total of at least 11 matches before the Scottish Premiership breaks for the tournament in mid-November. \"The initial report suggest he'll probably be out until after the [World Cup] break at this stage,\" Postecoglou told Sky Sports. \"We've got the final report to come, but it looks like he'll miss the next three or four weeks, which will put him out until after the break. \"The players are well aware of it, we went through a period last year where he was missing, and nothing really changes for us. It's about sticking to our team principles, he's a massive loss on and off the field, but just like any other club - we just have to deal with it.\" Summer signing Oliver Abildgaard is one of the options to replace McGregor until he returns.

In our latest column, Holly Shand and Wes Prickett (FPL Heisenberg) discuss how to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold, what to do with Aleksandar Mitrovic and much more! The Gameweek 11 deadline is earlier than usual at 6.30pm on Friday and it's not too late to join the official Sky Sports Fantasy League with code e7ft7m. Holly Shand: I think the injury to Trent Alexander-Arnold (£7.3m) has been a huge favour to his owners, who can finally let go of him after a disappointing start to the season. Reece James (£6.1m) owners should be cautious: his injury isn't thought to be a huge issue and if there's a chance he's available for Gameweek 12, he will be important for our squads. Joao Cancelo (£7.3m) and Kieran Trippier (£5.6m) are the must-own players among the premium options, given their chances of picking up attacking returns and bonus points. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  FPL Heisenberg: I haven't had Trent for a while now and I have no interest in going back there any time soon - even before his injury. So, if you have him he's an easy sell for the likes of Trippier, Eric Dier (£5.2m) or Lewis Dunk (£4.6m). With James it's a tougher decision, my current thoughts are I'll probably hold him as there are reports that he may only miss one Gameweek - however this decision depends on any news that may break in the next day or so. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  FPL Heisenberg: My plan at the time of writing is to hold Aleksandar Mitrovic (£6.8m), assuming he'll be back for this Gameweek. If he isn't, I have Andreas Pereira (£4.6m) as my first sub which is decent enough. I really need Mitrovic to be back for Gameweek 12 as I'm already stretched thin for that Gameweek with Man City and Arsenal blanking. \n              Play Fantasy Premier League here\n             \n              Premier League fixtures\n             \n              Premier League results\n             \n              Premier League top scorers & assisters\n             Holly Shand: Marco Silva was positive about Mitrovic's availability for Bournemouth, so keep an eye out on an update in his press conference on Friday. If it transpires that he is unavailable, with the quick turnaround to Blank Gameweek 12, we may need to sell him for Dominic Solanke (£5.7m). Holly Shand: Midweek Gameweeks tend to be low scoring with plenty of rotation and that's compounded by the blank in the schedule, plus injuries to some highly-owned players. Arsenal and Manchester City are the best teams in the Premier League so far this season, so it's reasonable to hold 3-4 of their players during the blank, especially those who you've owned for a while and may have valued tied up in them - Erling Haaland (£12.2m) and Gabriel Martinelli (£6.6m) are among the highest price risers in particular this campaign. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  FPL Heisenberg: It'll be really tempting to use your Free Hit chip in Blank Gameweek 12. I'd advise against this if possible, as later on in the season there will be bigger blank and double Gameweeks so your Free Hit will be really useful then. Therefore, my plan is to ride out Gameweek 12 the best I can, use my bench players and maybe a minus 4 to muddle my way through it. FPL Heisenberg: I like lots of options in the same price bracket as Luis Diaz (£8m). James Maddison (£8.3m), Wilfried Zaha (£7.4m), Jarrod Bowen (£8.2m) and Mason Mount (£7.6m) are all great replacements. Phil Foden (£8.2m) too after Man City get their blank out the way. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  If you need to free up cash, consider Leandro Trossard (£6.8m) who has two great fixtures and great form this season. Diogo Jota (£8.9m) isn't right now, Darwin Nunez (£8.8m) I'm a little more interested in, however there are still other forwards who I prefer. With Man City up next for Liverpool, I'm not going to be bringing in any of their players this week regardless. Holly Shand: Foden is the best replacement, despite the blank in Gameweek 12, if you aren't tripled up on Manchester City players already. Bowen and Maddison are also very credible options. Jota and Nunez aren't on my radar, since Liverpool haven't shown consistent form and the injury issues are mounting up across their best XI. FPL Heisenberg: Kepa Arrizabalaga (£4.4m) is a good shout as he's a bargain but I won't be using any of my upcoming transfers on changing my goalkeeper. If you are wildcarding, you can go for Kepa. If not, stick with who you've got until the World Cup break after Gameweek 16. Holly Shand: Most Fantasy managers will have bigger issues in their squad and so shouldn't be spending a precious transfer on a goalkeeper. If he's still first choice after Blank Gameweek 12, then buy him to get ahead of the curve. He could well be a very popular acquisition for Fantasy managers with unlimited transfers in play during the World Cup break. Holly Shand: In defence, Marc Guehi (£4.3m) has great fixtures, carries some goal threat from set pieces and is among the cheapest starting defenders in the game. In midfield, Bowen is still low-owned and has both recent form and good upcoming fixtures. He's on penalties and capable of racking up significant attacking returns. Up front, Solanke should continue to tick over with promising fixtures and he's the main man in the team. Expect 90 minutes every single game and spot-kicks too. FPL Heisenberg: Dunk, Mount and Gianluca Scamacca (£6.7m). Dunk has two really strong fixtures and is nailed on to play every Gameweek whereas some of the more exciting picks, like Ben Chilwell (£5.8m) for example, may suffer from rotation as the games are coming thick and fast now. Mount has hit form nicely and got a partial rest in the Champions League, coming off at half-time and still getting player of the match. Scamacca looks to be West Ham's main man up front now and he's getting lots of good chances, scoring goals too. Holly Shand: Yes, I would look to switch to a 3-5-2 soon: most of the midfielders priced around £8m look to be promising options right now. We can't afford to have a non-playing third forward for our benches right now, but hopefully, Solanke can fill that gap. We only need one premium right now when it comes to captaincy in Haaland, so that should leave the budget more flexible than normal. FPL Heisenberg: No, not necessarily. FPL changes quickly, it was only a couple of Gameweeks ago we all wanted to squeeze in three forwards. There's nothing wrong with going for five in midfield with a cheap forward, however, I personally prefer a 3-3-3 formation, with Andreas as cover should any of my forwards or midfielders miss out.

In just eight matches under the Dutchman, the 24-year-old has already bettered his assists tally from last season and has matched his goals total. The two strikes he produced away to Omonia Nicosia on Thursday were the fourth and fifth he has notched this season, while his brilliant flicked assist for Anthony Martial's goal was his third of what is shaping up to be a highly productive campaign. While Rashford's numbers are impressive, it's when and where he's converting his chances that catches the eye. The academy graduate's five goals have been spread across just three matches and have been responsible for winning Manchester United six extra points in those games. Rashford's first of the season came in the 2-1 win over Liverpool - Ten Hag's first victory - while the second two helped Man Utd to a 3-1 triumph over another big-six rival in Arsenal. \n              Europa League group tables\n             \n              Europa League Fixtures\n             \n              Europa League results\n             \n              Latest Europa League news\n             Then, in Cyprus, Rashford stepped off the bench at half-time with his side staring down the barrel of an embarrassing defeat to lead them to a hard-fought victory that kept them within touching distance of top spot in Europa League Group E. The re-emergence of Rashford as a big-game player is a welcome boost for Man Utd and Ten Hag, and may be coming at just the right time for the forward as he hunts a recall to an England squad crying out for a spark ahead of this winter's World Cup.Joe Shread Cristiano Ronaldo's entire career has been geared towards breaking records and making himself a global star, so there was something a little sad about watching the Champions League's record appearance holder and goalscorer flounder against European minnows Omonia Nicosia in the Europa League. Man Utd's 3-2 win in Cyprus was only the fifth time the 37-year-old has taken to the field in the competition - a perfect illustration of how he has operated at the highest level of European football for so long. In fairness to Ronaldo, he didn't turn his nose up at the opportunity to add to his monumental career goals tally against Omonia. In fact, he did all he could to find the net for just the second time in what is proving to be a frustrating season but, try as he might, the ball just wouldn't go in. The Portugal international had efforts saved by the goalkeeper, blocked by defenders, hit the side netting and fly over the bar as he shot with his right foot, his left foot, from close range and from long distance. Ronaldo even contrived to hit the post when Diogo Dalot presented him with a goal that was as good as open. It was a chance that he used to be able to score in his sleep. So desperate was Ronaldo to score that the final five minutes in Cyprus turned into a team-wide effort to get him on the scoresheet, even though Man Utd were holding onto a precarious lead. In the 90th minute, Ronaldo ignored the wide open Anthony Martial in favour of going for goal himself but, inevitably at this point, powered his dipping effort wide. Then, finally, it looked like Ronaldo would break his duck when Marcus Rashford spotted him lurking at the far post, ready to tap home his low cross. That was until Rashford shanked the pass, somehow missing his team-mate completely and extinguishing Ronaldo's hopes of marking a rare start with a much-needed goal. Ronaldo isn't used to taking on the likes of Omonia, isn't used to playing in the Europa League and isn't used to struggling for both goals and game time. These are unfamiliar times for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.Joe Shread Eddie Nketiah picked the ball up, turned and suddenly, it looked like he had the Bodo/Glimt defence in the palm of his hands. The Arsenal striker would carry the ball around 20 yards and put it just wide of goal from distance, but it showed how far the 23-year-old has come in the space of six months. From being lightweight, on the very periphery of the squad and seemingly heading out the door, to bustling past defenders with the new physique he has managed to build over the summer. It's the most noticeable improvement in his game - it's not the first time he's showed it. His cameo in the Saturday Night Football win over Fulham in August, which helped Arsenal bustle past a stubborn Fulham side, was an early glimpse of his eye-catching new power. But while Nketiah has one new edge, he needs to develop another. His poacher's goal was well taken, but more spurned chances mean the pressure is still off Gabriel Jesus in that Arsenal striker battle. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In the first-half Nketiah tried, and failed, to square to Gabriel Martinelli when one-on-one. After half-time, he put a similar chance over after a superb slide-through pass from Martin Odegaard. \"You have to look at what you have done - great. But what can you do better?\" said Arteta about Nketiah after the game. If Nketiah can't put those additional chances away, then it's unlikely he can get more chances in the Premier League above Jesus. And if those minutes do not come, then he can't develop in the way he would like to.Sam Blitz October is a gruelling month for Arsenal. Nine matches in 29 days, with four out of the last six being away from home. But what will delight Mikel Arteta is that eight changes can be made and results and performances don't waver. Arsenal have barely been required to step out of second gear against Tottenham and Bodo/Glimt, which is the perfect tonic ahead of a major contest against Liverpool this weekend. Bar Cedric Soares, who is only just back from injury, every single available member of the first-team squad is used - which is testament to the depth Arteta has at his disposal. Last season, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Kieran Tierney were both deemed irreplaceable but are now struggling to show that Ben White and Oleksandr Zinchenko should be dropped as full-backs, meaning they can be used to keep the Europa League levels high. With another goal to his name, Fabio Vieira is taking some creative burden from Martin Odegaard, while the calmness of Rob Holding means too much is not asked of William Saliba so early into his Arsenal first-team career. Injuries will eventually come up on Arsenal, but on Thursday's showing these second-string players showed they can step up to the mark. When Arsenal failed to qualify for the Champions League in May, both Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher said the Thursday-Sunday routine would damage their season. But they're top of the league and barely breaking sweat in Europe. It's not been too bad so far.Sam Blitz When substitutes Gianluca Scamacca and Lucas Paqueta teamed up cleverly for West Ham's late winner against Anderlecht, it offered a real glimpse of what the duo could offer David Moyes's side in attack this season. The Europa Conference League clash featuring the top two in group B was finely balanced when David Moyes decided to roll the dice and make a triple change with just 20 minutes left at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. The Hammers manager introduced Scamacca and Paqueta in a show of real strength from the bench and soon they had combined neatly on the edge of the Anderlecht box to maintain the visitors' 100 per cent record in the competition. Scamacca still had work to do to find the far corner of the net after good skill by his Brazilian team-mate had created the opening, but he did it unerringly for his fifth goal for the club since joining from Sassuolo for £35.5 million in July. And expect the Italy international and Paqueta, who arrived from Lyon for £51m the following month, to start at home against Fulham on Sunday.Richard Morgan Super 6 is back, bigger and better than ever with a £250,000 jackpot.

He made the comments after the Easter Road defender went down in the box during a match between the sides and was awarded a penalty by referee David Dickinson, while Dons defender Liam Scales was sent off. Aberdeen went on to lose the match 3-1 which then resulted in Goodwin's outburst that has landed him an eight-match ban from the SFA, of which two games are suspended until the end of the season. Aberdeen said they were \"extremely disappointed\" and have appealed the ban, which would see Goodwin miss games against Dundee United, Hearts, Partick Thistle, Motherwell, Rangers and Hibernian. \"We do not expect to get the written reasons behind the decision until next week, but we will be appealing this decision,\" an Aberdeen statement added.

Walker was forced off in the first half of City's 6-3 derby victory over Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Walker came into the game feeling a niggle in his groin, which worsened during the game and he was taken off just before half-time. No timescale has been put on Walker's potential return but it is understood that Man City and Walker believe the right-back still has a chance of featuring in the World Cup. Walker, 32, has been known to be a \"quicker healer\" from past injuries but his availability will depend on how his body reacts to the operation, with the next fortnight key. Walker tweeted a picture of himself after the surgery, with the message: \"As players we have to appreciate injuries are part and parcel of the game we love. My operation on Tuesday was a success and now I can concentrate on my rehab and getting back to full fitness. I will be supporting my team-mates every day in any way I can.\" Man City have taken the decision to have the operation now because of Walker's pace and the fact the injury can't be managed while still playing.

The two teams also held up a banner reading 'PROTECT THE PLAYERS' just before the game started, while the Wembley arch was also lit teal. The match came four days on from the publication of a report from an independent investigation which said verbal and emotional abuse and sexual misconduct \"had become systemic\" in the NWSL. Following England's 2-1 win over the USA at Wembley, Wiegman said of the show of solidarity: \"It was very important. We all wanted to be part of it and be very supportive because it's very horrible that these situations occur in the game with the players, but the problem is wider than that. \"Of course, for the victims it's horrible and now they have to relive it again and it should stop.

The players did an incredible job of using this game as a platform to fight against it.\" \"Obviously, it's been an extremely difficult week for everyone. I want to say that I'm proud of the players to even be on the field. It wasn't easy. I applaud their bravery. I applaud their fearless mentality and their relentlessness. \"Once again they showed that nothing can stop them from playing the game they love.

She says it has been difficult for the squad to relive some of their experiences following the findings, but that they have grown closer and feel united together. \"It's horrifying,\" said USA's co-captain Rapinoe. \"It's been difficult for the players, some of the players play in those clubs, have been coached by those coaches likely have been abused in one form or another by some of those coaches or in some of those environments. \"It can definitely be re-triggering or re-traumatising and just to have to deal with that on such an incredible occasion here at Wembley and to participate in this game, which is so exciting, I mean the juxtaposition is just ridiculous. \"It's nice to be here together as a team, I feel like it's really powerful for us all to be together as a national team. It has been very difficult, I can't even imagine [what it's felt like] for the players most affected, or just the names that we know and probably a lot of names that we don't know. \"In a way, it's really sad to say this, but we are used to having to deal with one thing or another. It seems to bring us closer and definitely unify the team. \"It's been really difficult for everyone in the entire landscape of women's sports, no one wants to see anything like this. But hopefully this can be a moment in time that you say, 'None of this happened again'.\" Portland Thorns have sacked president of soccer Gavin Wilkinson and president of business Mike Golub following the investigation into abuse in NWSL. Wilkinson was found to have blamed a player who accused former coach Paul Riley of sexual misconduct, claiming she \"put Riley in a bad position\". Riley is accused of sexual coercion and harassment during his time as Portland head coach. The Yates Investigation found senior club officials also knew of other alleged, non-sexual abuses as far back as 2014 but did not act on the information. Portland were also found to have impeded and delayed the US Soccer Federation investigation led by Sally Yates. Portland Thorns owner Merritt Paulson stepped down from club duties on Tuesday. United States midfielder Lindsey Horan believes there will be a ripple effect that sweeps through professional women's sport after the investigation, which found abuse in the NWSL to be widespread. \"This investigation came forward and obviously I'm grateful for that, but it took way too long,\" said Horan, who is currently on loan at Lyon from Portland Thorns. \"This whole thing was prolonged. I sit here and think 'it's not done'. This is all over the world. Being a player in Europe right now, I know that.\" More than 200 players in the North American top tier were spoken to for the report, which concluded that abuse and sexual misconduct spanned multiple teams and coaches, and that the NWSL and governing body US Soccer failed to put in \"basic measures\" to safeguard its players. Horan believes these findings are only the beginning of a much wider problem which exists across \"women's football in general\". \"This isn't just it,\" she continued. \"It's not just the NWSL. This is women's football in general. It's women in general, we have these problems all over the world. It's a global, systemic problem.

What's happening in the US is not a US issue. Unfortunately, this is something that is currently going on in multiple leagues. \"Change is on the horizon.

They should never have to speak about these things because they should never go through these things, and it is disgusting. \"But the NWSLPA have done a fantastic job there. They are a brilliant group of women and players and behind the scenes they work tirelessly to make a safe space for everybody to speak about things. \"My heart is with them and hope that finally these things can be put to an end.\" Daly's England team-mate Lucy Bronze, who honed her skills in the US college system, says eliminating abusive behaviour and sexual misconduct is \"top of the list\" of changes required in women's sport. \"Women's sport in general tends to have these issues and I think they probably have been going on for a long time, but people have never been brave enough to speak out,\" said Bronze. \"So it's not necessarily a new thing. The new thing is that we're finally fighting back against it. \"It's obviously very sad to read these stories. I'm very fortunate to have had a career where I've not had any of these problems. \"I've never looked back and thought, 'that was a bit funny'. I'd like to think that a lot of my team-mates are fortunate enough to say that as well. \"We've said for a long time, a lot of things need to change in women's sport and this is top of the list to change. \"It's not just women's football that has horrible abusive stories and allegations that happen - there are many women's sports where it's happened and we support all the females that come out and speak.\" The Athletic's Meg Linehan to Sky Sports News: \"I don't know if anything was super surprising. I think it was just the level of detail was really new, but I think one of the biggest conclusions from that report was that it goes well beyond the NWSL. \"Players have affirmed that too. It's not just women's professional soccer, it's at the youth level, it's a global systemic problem and I think we are all just trying to wrap our heads around the scale of it at this very moment. \"What we are all really waiting on is to see what the accountability piece of this is going to look like. There's going to be policy changes, and we know that, but I think what is really to be determined is are the owners, the general managers and all of the people in power, who have built this system and who have enabled abuse of pretty much every kind within the NWSL, if there are going to be repercussions for them. \"A few owners have removed themselves from the decision-making process in the NWSL. But that is really all we've seen so far. \"Everyone I have spoken to has said we don't pretend like we are going to know all the answers. There were institutional failings from pretty much every institution that was involved, and part of the problem is that those institutions also pointed fingers at each other that they were actually the ones responsible. \"So, I think it is going to take all of those institutions but what we've seen really over the course of the past year plus is the players are the ones who are forcing this change, who I think are being forced to own the process even though they shouldn't have to own that process. \"But it has been player pressure and it has been public pressure that has really driven this, and it took reporting and journalism to reveal it. \"The institutions weren't doing the right things, but can they do that now?

RIP Prof.\" Son, who had credited Ventrone for being the inspiration behind his hat-trick against Leicester last month, joined Kane in hailing the impact of the experienced coach. \"The world has lost a truly special person,\" Son wrote on Instagram. \"Gian, you helped me get through the hardest times, and together we celebrated some some incredible memories. I cannot put in enough words my gratitude to you, and how much I owe to you. \"We will miss you so, so much. Thank you for everything my friend. I am sending all of my love to you and all of your family.\" Ventrone was at Juventus from 1994 to 2004 - during which time Conte played for Juventus - working under Marcelo Lippi and Carlo Ancelotti. He has also worked for French club AC Ajaccio, Italian side Catania and in China for JS Suning and Guangzhou. The Italian oversaw a complete overhaul of Tottenham's fitness, with Conte's side having ran more than any other team in the Premier League this season. Last month, Son had spoken about the impact Ventrone has had on him off the pitch. \"I have a really, really good relationship with Gian Piero,\" said the Spurs forward, who went to hug Ventrone after that win over the Foxes. \"He has been so helpful, giving me always a big hug in tough times and even great times he has always been next to me and every staff. \"It means a lot. Not as football-wise, I think life-wise he gives me so much advice, which I am really grateful.\" Son was among the Spurs players who struggled after one of Ventrone's intense, two-hour long pre-season workouts in South Korea over the summer, which caused Harry Kane to throw up. Even though he worked the Spurs players to the limit, he was still adored by the squad. \"It's all love for Gian Piero, actually,\" said Spurs full-back Matt Doherty in the summer. \"Normally when you have a fitness coach like that who is running you ragged you start to not like him, but that's not the case. \"We all absolutely love him. We've got so much respect for him that we do whatever he tells us to.\" Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, the Spurs midfielder, added: \"We love him. He's a great guy with great experience. They put us through some great work and we know we will improve and it's fantastic.

The 20-year-old left his homeland 18 months ago to train with Hearts before securing a three-year deal with the Perth club. His family were forced to flee the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv when Russia invaded in February and he felt helpless as he searched for updates. \"The first few weeks I probably didn't sleep a single night, I was on my phone for 24 hours a day just checking the news and trying to keep in touch with as many people as I could,\" he told Sky Sports News. \"You never know what could happen to them and I was really worried for them. \"They had to leave Kyiv in the first few days because it was dangerous and they moved to my grandparents, but now it's getting better. \"I haven't been home for a year and a half, but I'm really grateful that I've still got a place to go because I know that a lot of people lost their houses and lost their families.\" Kucheriavyi spent part of last season on loan at Kelty Hearts where he scored the goal to secure the League Two title, but continued to train at St Johnstone every day. He believes the support of his team-mates and Scottish football fans helped him cope with the trauma of what was happening in his homeland. \"Especially the first few days, I was going through tough times and Liam Gordon (club captain) and everyone in the changing room really helped me,\" he added. \"They made sure I was feeling well and if I needed any support they would be there for me. \"The club, the town and Scottish people in general showed help and support. \"Even during away matches you could see Ukraine flags all over the stands. I know that a lot of Ukrainian people moved to Scotland and I'm sure they feel welcome here. \"I didn't expect as much support as I got. It makes me feel really warm and grateful for what the Scottish people and club do for me.\" Perth Council invited Kucheriavyi to be involved in events for Ukrainian refugees and he started his own GoFundMe page to raise money for those in need. He said it was tough to understand what some of them were going through: \"Sometimes I don't know how to react to their stories because some of them are losing homes, their fathers or husbands are out their fighting and holding guns in their hands. \"I can't even imagine what these people are going through, but hopefully it will finish soon.\"", "erling-haaland-man-city-boss-pep-guardiola-insists-there-is-no-release-clause-in-norwegian-strikers-contract": "Pep Guardiola insists there is no release clause in Erling Haaland's contract, saying the Norwegian striker is \"settled\" and \"happy\" at Manchester City.

On Wednesday, the department said it had established an independent review to consider what went wrong with the original pathology report into the deaths at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final and ensure similar mistakes were not made in the future. Ninety-seven football fans died in the crush at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on April 15 1989. The pathology review, which will be chaired by forensic science expert Glenn Taylor, was set up following a recommendation in a 2017 report by Bishop James Jones. Original inquests, which were quashed by the High Court in 2012, heard no evidence from after 3.15pm on the day of the disaster. The decision was based on pathology evidence that all the victims suffered the injuries which caused their deaths before that time. However, the Hillsborough Independent Panel found the evidence was flawed and it was highly likely what happened after 3.15pm - the time when the first ambulance arrived on the pitch - was significant in determining whether the victims could have survived. In his 2017 report The Patronising Disposition Of Unaccountable Power, Bishop Jones said: \"It is difficult to overstate the impact of the failures of pathology at the first inquest. \"The impact is deeply personal for those families who feel they will now never know how their loved one died, but it also has a wider resonance - leading as it did to the necessity for new inquest proceedings 25 years after the disaster occurred.\" The review, commissioned by the Pathology Delivery Board (PDB) and overseen by the Home Office, began in July and Mr Taylor is expected to report his findings to the Home Secretary next summer. Its terms of reference include recognising the failures in pathology, assessing whether there is risk of similar failings being made again and considering if there are lessons learnt which can be built into the development of Home Office registered forensic pathologists and the wider provision of pathology services. Bishop Jones, the former Bishop of Liverpool, set out 25 points of learning as part of his report on the experiences of the Hillsborough families. He recommended the Government give full consideration to a Hillsborough Law, which would include a duty of candour for police officers.

Lopetegui had been in charge at Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan since June 2019, but was increasingly under pressure with Sevilla having won just once in eight league games. He was linked with the job at Molineux back in 2016, but became manager of the Spanish national team, with whom he spent the best part of the next two years before an ill-fated 14-match spell in charge at Real Madrid.

It will be Sampaoli's second stint with the record six-times Europa League winners, who have suffered a poor start to the season, having won only one match in all competitions. They are 17th in La Liga on five points, a place and a point above the relegation zone - their worst start to a league season since being promoted back to the top-flight in 2001. The club's board is facing questions from angry fans who had high expectations after Sevilla finished fourth last term having battled with Real Madrid for the title for most of the campaign.

Matt Taylor's reign as Rotherham manager began with a 1-1 draw against Millwall at the New York Stadium. Taylor was appointed as the Millers new boss on Tuesday after agreeing to leave League One Exeter and he was thrown straight into Championship action.

But, in a performance that may have caught the attention of Gareth Southgate as he ponders his midfield contingent for the World Cup, Loftus-Cheek shone as Chelsea produced their best performance of an inconsistent season. The 26-year-old - who was a member of Southgate's squad in Russia four years ago - used his muscular frame to assert physical dominance over Milan's midfield and ended the match with more duels won (10) than any player on the field. Loftus-Cheek also won possession for his side on nine occasions - a figure only Reece James could better among either side. The Chelsea academy graduate spent the final months of Thomas Tuchel's reign filling a variety of roles, including wing-back and right-wing, but showed the heart of midfield remains his strongest position and, in doing so, repaid the faith shown in him by his new head coach.Joe Shread Chelsea's decision to allow Fikayo Tomori to join AC Milan has looked foolish at times over the last year but the former academy graduate did not enjoy a happy homecoming on Wednesday night. The 24-year-old, a key figure in Milan's Serie A title triumph last season following a successful loan spell at the San Siro in the previous campaign, was unable to deliver a performance befitting of one of the best young centre-backs in Italy. Instead, he looked awkward up against his former side's fluid attack, most notably for their second goal, when his failure to cut out Reece James' right-wing cross allowed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to stab a first-time finish into the net. It was not his only poor moment. There was also a loose pass in his own half before the break which allowed Mason Mount to put Raheem Sterling through on goal. The error might have been costly had centre-back partner Pierre Kalulu not raced back to make the tackle. Tomori has credit in the bank for all that he has achieved in Italy, but the return to Stamford Bridge was an opportunity to show his former side they were wrong to sell him - and show Gareth Southgate he deserves a place in the England squad for Qatar. This sub-par performance will not define him, of course, but he will return to Milan feeling he has achieved neither of those aims. Southgate did not use Tomori against Italy and left him out of the squad to face Germany during the recent international break. If his position looked at risk already, it looks even more precarious now.Nick Wright Celtic once again showed some signs they can compete at Champions League level, but once again it seemed their inexperience at Europe's top level cost them. They impressed early against Real Madrid in their opening group match, but fell to defeat after wasting early chances then had to settle for a draw with Shakhtar Donetsk after again failing to capitalise on their spells of dominance. They went into the game without their first-choice centre-backs and lost captain Callum McGregor before the break, but they pressed Leipzig at times and took advantage of some of their slack passing. Jota's equaliser was well worked, but after that they seemed to fall out of the game a little. Stephen Welsh made his Champions League debut as he started in place of injured Carl Starfelt, in fact only a few have played Champions League football before this season, and it is a steep learning curve. Ange Postecoglou said it is difficult to teach players that they belong at this level, but it is something they will need to embrace if they are to have a hope of securing European football after Christmas. The quality of the opposition cannot be forgotten either.

Wilkinson was found to have blamed a player who accused former coach Paul Riley of sexual misconduct, claiming she \"put Riley in a bad position\". Riley is accused of sexual coercion and harassment during his time as Portland head coach. The Yates Investigation found senior club officials also knew of other alleged, non-sexual abuses as far back as 2014 but did not act on the information. Portland were also found to have impeded and delayed the US Soccer Federation investigation led by Sally Yates. Portland Thorns owner Merritt Paulson stepped down from club duties on Tuesday. United States midfielder Lindsey Horan believes there will be a ripple effect that sweeps through professional women's sport after the investigation, which found abuse in the NWSL to be widespread. \"This investigation came forward and obviously I'm grateful for that, but it took way too long,\" said Horan, who is currently on loan at Lyon from Portland Thorns. \"This whole thing was prolonged. I sit here and think 'it's not done'. This is all over the world. Being a player in Europe right now, I know that.\" More than 200 players in the North American top tier were spoken to for the report, which concluded that abuse and sexual misconduct spanned multiple teams and coaches, and that the NWSL and governing body US Soccer failed to put in \"basic measures\" to safeguard its players. Horan believes these findings are only the beginning of a much wider problem which exists across \"women's football in general\". \"This isn't just it,\" she continued. \"It's not just the NWSL. This is women's football in general. It's women in general, we have these problems all over the world. It's a global, systemic problem. I don't want this to be the end point. \"I feel hurt and disturbed and obviously just so much anger for these players, as well.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  United States and Portland Thorns winger Crystal Dunn expects the NWSL report to hold the individuals at fault \"accountable\" for their actions, with US Soccer pledging to implement wholesale change off the back of the findings. \"This is a huge moment for the NWSL,\" Dunn said. \"It's not just a huge moment for our domestic league, but leagues across the globe. What's happening in the US is not a US issue. Unfortunately, this is something that is currently going on in multiple leagues. \"Change is on the horizon. This report coming out is the nail in the coffin. It's going to allow for a lot of accountability, which up until now hasn't taken place. \"I am quite hopeful that the healing phase can take place. Now that results are public and open for everyone to see, there is no hiding behind it. That transparency is exactly what we need in order to push change forward.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  England international Rachel Daly said the women's football community \"stand in solidarity with the players\". \"I was saddened to see it [the report]. Coming off the training pitch to that news, it is heart-breaking and it was sickening,\" the Aston Villa player told Sky Sports. \"I could use many words to describe how I felt about that but those really jump to mind. \"It's absolutely terrifying that girls are still going through this and that people are abusing power. \"For us as females, it is a very dangerous place to be when things like that happen and all I can do and say is that the rest of the women's football community stand in solidarity with the girls that have been affected. \"For me personally, I'm very proud of them to come out and openly have a safe space to speak about these things. They should never have to speak about these things because they should never go through these things, and it is disgusting. \"But the NWSLPA have done a fantastic job there. They are a brilliant group of women and players and behind the scenes they work tirelessly to make a safe space for everybody to speak about things. \"My heart is with them and hope that finally these things can be put to an end.\" Daly's England team-mate Lucy Bronze, who honed her skills in the US college system, says eliminating abusive behaviour and sexual misconduct is \"top of the list\" of changes required in women's sport. \"Women's sport in general tends to have these issues and I think they probably have been going on for a long time, but people have never been brave enough to speak out,\" said Bronze. \"So it's not necessarily a new thing. The new thing is that we're finally fighting back against it. \"It's obviously very sad to read these stories. I'm very fortunate to have had a career where I've not had any of these problems. \"I've never looked back and thought, 'that was a bit funny'. I'd like to think that a lot of my team-mates are fortunate enough to say that as well. \"We've said for a long time, a lot of things need to change in women's sport and this is top of the list to change. \"It's not just women's football that has horrible abusive stories and allegations that happen - there are many women's sports where it's happened and we support all the females that come out and speak.\" The Athletic's Meg Linehan to Sky Sports News: \"I don't know if anything was super surprising. I think it was just the level of detail was really new, but I think one of the biggest conclusions from that report was that it goes well beyond the NWSL. \"Players have affirmed that too. It's not just women's professional soccer, it's at the youth level, it's a global systemic problem and I think we are all just trying to wrap our heads around the scale of it at this very moment. \"What we are all really waiting on is to see what the accountability piece of this is going to look like. There's going to be policy changes, and we know that, but I think what is really to be determined is are the owners, the general managers and all of the people in power, who have built this system and who have enabled abuse of pretty much every kind within the NWSL, if there are going to be repercussions for them. \"A few owners have removed themselves from the decision-making process in the NWSL. But that is really all we've seen so far. \"Everyone I have spoken to has said we don't pretend like we are going to know all the answers. There were institutional failings from pretty much every institution that was involved, and part of the problem is that those institutions also pointed fingers at each other that they were actually the ones responsible. \"So, I think it is going to take all of those institutions but what we've seen really over the course of the past year plus is the players are the ones who are forcing this change, who I think are being forced to own the process even though they shouldn't have to own that process. \"But it has been player pressure and it has been public pressure that has really driven this, and it took reporting and journalism to reveal it. \"The institutions weren't doing the right things, but can they do that now? That is the question everyone is asking.\"", "lee-tomlin-right-time-for-me-to-retire-from-playing-football": "After 17 years and nearly 600 career appearances, it is the moment for Lee Tomlin to call time on a career that saw him travel from League Two, through non-League and into the Premier League. At 33, injuries have taken their toll on the talismanic midfielder, and his body simply cannot handle the strain any longer. \"I went into pre-season at Doncaster and I was loving it,\" Tomlin tells Sky Sports after announcing his retirement. \"But the last couple of months of playing and training every day have taken their toll on my body, and it's just been a bit too much for me, especially with the amount of painkillers I have to take to get through it. \"Playing football is all I've ever known, but to try and carry on is too much for me on my body. I wake up every morning in pain, and I'm trying to sleep at night in pain. \"I don't think anyone's really ready to retire. I wish it was a job that I could do for a lot more years. But you just have to come to terms with it and accept it. \"I spoke to people close to me and I spoke to the gaffer. It's a decision I had to make, but I've made it for the right reasons.\" Tomlin began his career in League Two as a 16-year-old with Rushden & Diamonds, and he went on to play for them for four more seasons after their relegation to the Conference (now National League), before his impressive performances saw him picked up by Peterborough in League One in 2010. \n              League Two table\n             \n              League Two news\n             That was followed by a spell at Middlesbrough, and then a move to Bournemouth and the Premier League in 2015.He reflects on those years as probably the best of his career. \"One highlight was undoubtedly winning promotion with Peterborough from League One to the Championship,\" he says. \"That was an incredible moment. \"Then at Middlesbrough, I know we lost in the play-off final in the end to Norwich, but that whole season was unbelievable. I loved it there. The fans, the club, the whole atmosphere. Every day was brilliant. \"But the top one has to be making my debut in the Premier League. Even I don't think I dreamt big enough as a kid to think that could happen. I was just a young lad on a council estate, and I didn't think it could happen to people like us. But the more stories you hear now and see that it can happen to anyone as long as you work hard. \"I was playing in League Two at 16, but even then I felt like you had to be built differently or come from somewhere different. I don't know. I just didn't think it would be possible. \"Maybe If I had believed in myself from a younger age I would have had the chance to stay in the Premier League for a bit longer. Everyone always talks about my ability. I think if I really believed I was meant to be there and was worthy of being there I would have.\" Now is the time to look forward rather than back for Tomlin, who will enjoy a few months relaxing at home before cracking on to the next phase of his life - with a future in management the next dream he aspires to. \"For the first few months I just want to spend time with the family, and be there as much as I can for them,\" he says. \"I want to make sure they're all alright and happy. \"But then it'll be going on to do my coaching badges and kicking on from there. I'm on my final assessment on my B Licence. Then it's onto my A Licence and my Pro Licence. It's not something I'm going to rush into, but I will be doing more of it now I've got the time to do it. \"I've had a lot of old-school managers, and some new managers, and you can pick up little things from each of them. That's what I'd love to be.\" Tomlin has worked under plenty of top bosses in his career, but believes Aitor Karanka was the most influential of his career. \"I worked with him at Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest,\" he says. \"I've always just done well for him. He's very strict and whatever he says goes, but he knows how to manage his players and with his attacking players he wants to let them do what they do. He let me off a leash. \"When I first went into Middlesbrough I lost a stone-and-a-half with him in a couple of months. That was the first time a manager had ever said 'you need to do this or that' to me. Training was such hard work and his man management helped me a lot. He knew how to treat me and talk to me, and it helped a lot.\" And it was also Karanka who drew the best performance of his career, when Middlesbrough went to Manchester City as a Championship side in 2015 and beat them 2-0 in the FA Cup. Tomlin takes one last moment to reminisce. \"I remember speaking to Dean Whitehead and Jonathan Woodgate after, and they were saying you've got your move to the Premier League after that,\" he says. \"But I didn't even think about it like that. \"It was just the one performance I felt that, against the players it was against as well, that it was just unbelievable. I just felt in that game that I was flying and gliding past people.\" There have been few better than Tomlin to watch when in full flight in the Football League in the past couple of decades.

It evoked poignant emotions. Unforgettable memories. The novelty is yet to wear off for White. She's still visibly beaming from a historic summer spent entertaining audiences up and down the country as the Lionesses landed a first European crown. \"There's no feeling like it,\" she said. Getting accustomed to the resulting notoriety, however, never came quite as naturally. Endlessly humble, the Euros champion has always typically shirked away from the limelight. Unfortunately for her, it's an occupational by-product. White's star-studded career, filled with unrivalled success and personal achievement, reached its crescendo at Wembley Stadium in late July. Ever since, her name has become irreversibly connected with the most successful chapter in the history of England Women's national team. Her induction into the 'Legends of Football' hall of fame this week, alongside Gareth Southgate, is testament to that fact. She's an icon. For some lesser-known players competing in their first major tournament over the summer, being catapulted to stardom has been a shock. Manchester United's Ella Toone spoke exclusively to Sky Sports recently, revealing she can no longer walk down the street without being recognised and hounded for photos. \n              Women's Super League table\n             \n              Women's Super League fixtures\n             \n              Get a NOW Day Pass for £9.98\n             \n              How to follow the WSL on Sky Sports\n             But celebrity status is nothing new to White. Despite her modesty, the former Manchester City forward has been the face of the women's game for some time now. She's the Lionesses most-decorated goalscorer. She carried the torch at six major tournaments. She won everything there is to win domestically, all while contributing to powerful and formidable change in the women's game. A model professional, her influence cannot be understated. Yet, as she poses for an infinite number of photos with young fans at a local U11 tournament in Brentford, her demeanour is predictably unassuming. She greets each admirer individually, and spends time talking to all the 'Primary Stars' teams who are competing in a tournament to celebrate 30 years of the Premier League. The event, held a short distance from Brentford's Community Stadium (a host venue at Euro 2022), shone a light on the Premier League's increased funding of Emerging Talent Centres for aspiring young girls. It's an opportunity that was ill-afforded to players whose upbringing mirrored White's. Amid the 1990s, girls playing football was still remarkably taboo, as White recalls. \"There was a picture that went around of me recently looking sad in a newspaper from my childhood,\" she began. \"'Do a sad face, Ellen. It's for the newspaper'. \"I was stopped from playing football with the boys - I was devastated. They were my best mates, so then to be told you are no longer allowed to play because you're a girl, it was horrendous.\" She continued: \"Being able to touch so many different communities now is so important. These kinds of opportunities are inspiring. They just didn't exist before. There is talent everywhere and it starts at grassroots. These initiatives are designed to help develop and nourish and hone that talent. It will help grow the national team in the future.\" Fast forward to 2022, 20 years on from the first airing of Bend it Like Beckham in cinemas, and women's football has finally taken its rightful place in the mainstream. Billboards adorned with Women's Super League stars are now commonplace. Progress had been steady prior to the summer, but Euro 2022 represented a necessary tipping point. Not only did it serve to establish England as a force on the international stage, it has since initiated profound societal change. Enter 23 powerful Lionesses, each armed with a Euro winner's medal. \"As a collective, we want to help change,\" White said. \"We know the stats. The opportunities to play sport in school are too limited. It was actually Lotte [Wubben-Moy] that initiated the open letter, and the group were 100 per cent behind it. Collectively we've got more power and we want to be that reason for change. \"Obviously winning the Euros gave us that opportunity to speak out. We want this to happen for young girls, to feel empowered by opportunity. Accessibility is the main issue but hopefully we're on the right path. It's not set in stone, but we really hope that days like today and with the funding that's now available there will be a big shift.\" A series of near-misses and many false dawns of previous tournaments have caused heartache among previous England squads. Not this one. This one is \"special\", White says. \"I've said so many times how much I loved playing for England. It was a complete privilege and honour. My one dream was to achieve something with England. \"The team was so special that I felt it was the right time to achieve something. To be able to do that, in the most iconic game you could ever think of, at Wembley Stadium, was written in the stars. I feel really lucky. \"When people say 'we haven't won a trophy since 1966 and then you guys came along' - I think, what on earth have we done? It's mental.\" Lionesses fever swept through the country like a magnet over the summer months, attracting generations of new fans at an overwhelming rate. Yet for White, her Lionesses tenure was reaching its natural conclusion. It was a decision she took before the tournament commenced. \"I'd already made the decision to retire pre-tournament. It looks a bit better that we won it, doesn't it? I'd thought about it for a little while. I told very few people because I didn't want sad eyes watching me thinking 'this is the last time'. \"My husband was bawling his eyes out. He's been there through a lot of it, same as my mum and dad. It was very emotional for me. It was amazing to see them in the crowd and for them to experience the raw emotion with me. It was the perfect moment for me to retire.\" When quizzed about England's prospects for the future, she smirked and replied: \"I can say what I want now.\" New beginnings are on the horizon for White, and for England, but the two have parted ways for the final time. Her legacy, however, will continue to be at the forefront of positive change in the sport. Speaking as the Lionesses' \"biggest fan\", she finished by saying: \"This summer has transformed the way people look at us. \"We're a force to be reckoned with under Sarina. The way we play, the style we play, and the mentality. We're ruthless. Perhaps they haven't seen that in an England team before. For years we've been like 'we want to win something'. Now we have. \"I obviously want them to go on and win more trophies. I believe that they can. It won't be easy [at the World Cup in 2023], but I've got my full faith in them.

The Spain, Portugal and Ukraine bid for the 2030 tournament is backed by UEFA and will compete against other candidacies such as a collaboration between Egypt, Greece and Saudi Arabia, and a joint South American proposal from Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Chile. The Times reported on Tuesday that the plan is for Ukraine to host one World Cup group in the tournament. The decision as to who will host the tournament in eight years from now will be decided at a FIFA Congress in 2024, where the 211 member associations will vote on which group is best. By 2030, the World Cup will have expanded to a 48-team tournament, an increase of 16 more teams from the current format.

In August of this year, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Paraguay announced they would be making a four-country bid to bring the World Cup back to South America. Apart from Paraguay, all of the countries have hosted the World Cup before, but not since the 1970s. The last time a World Cup was held on the continent was for the 2014 tournament in Brazil. Sky Sports News understands another three-country bid is expected from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Greece. None of these three countries have hosted the World Cup before. In 2018, it was announced that Morocco will make a bid for the 2030 World Cup, with a possible joint-bid with fellow African members Tunisia and Algeria on the cards. Morocco have failed in their bids to host the World Cup in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010. Another inter-confederation bid on the cards is one led by Israel, with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain options to support that venture. Both Israel and the UAE have hosted editions of the Asia Cup over the past 60 years. Australia have been mentioned as a potential World Cup host on two separate occasions. In 2015, it was rumoured that New Zealand were looking to team up with the nation in a joint-bid. But in 2019, it was announced that talks were under way over an Australia-Indonesia joint-bid instead. Both Theresa May and Boris Johnson expressed a desire as Prime Minister to put forward England as a host nation for the 2030 World Cup. However, it was announced in February of this year that England would be part of a UK and Ireland joint-bid for the 2028 European Championships.

In his post-match press conference at Anfield, he said: \"He had a good game, defensively especially, and scored a wonderful goal. I was happy he set it up differently. \"We cannot talk about that every week, but Trent has no defensive problem, we have a defensive problem - hopefully 'had' - because our timing was not right and we take risk in defending, everybody knows that. \"If the timing is not right, you open gaps, and these gaps are very often behind Trent; not because of him, because of other situations and then he has to track back. \"We were not in the perfect moment and that's why we adjusted it slightly.\" Super 6 is back, bigger and better than ever with a £250,000 jackpot.

They strolled to a 2-0 victory at Anfield, only needing to reach a canter during entries into Rangers' often unguarded box. The result looked to be a forgone conclusion from the first whistle, with Jurgen Klopp unusually opting to sacrifice a midfield body to bolster his attacking charges. It had the desired effect. The most entertaining, or perhaps captivating, battle of the evening turned out to unfold between Darwin Nunez and the Gers' veteran goalkeeper Allan McGregor, who deserves a medal for reducing the scoring to a respectable pace. Klopp had assured big-money signing Nunez he need not worry about form or numbers before the game, both would come in time, but the striker's insistence to improve in both brackets was desperately clear. And had it not been for McGregor running interference, there would have been tangible improvements. Nunez had more shots than any other Liverpool player on the night (six) - the most any Reds player has managed without scoring in a group-stage game since Sadio Mane against Red Bull Salzburg in December 2019. His movement was intelligent, thriving as the focal point of a formation geared towards attacking efficacy. It was built around the 23-year-old's strengths, loading the frontline with inventiveness and creativity in order to generate a consistent supply. He was central to Liverpool's overall dominance. Speaking after the game, Klopp recalled a particular \"favourite moment\" in which the Uruguayan made a darting run into the box in an attempt to cut the ball back for his onrushing strike partners. The work he did was selfless and selfish in equal measure. \"We saw how good he is in these situations,\" his manager said. \n              Alexander-Arnold scores stunner in Liverpool win\n             \n              Champions League group tables\n             \n              Transfer Centre LIVE!\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             His snapshot, a mere two minutes into the game, was a sign of things to come as Nunez peppered McGregor's goal. The breakthrough proved elusive, but the performance was packed to the brim with drive and endeavour. While his bedding-in period has not been quite as seamless as notable other Premier League strikers, signed in the summer at lavish price points, his quality is undoubted and his stature will grow with every opportunity he is afforded. Given time, he will earn his rightful moment in the spotlight.Laura Hunter Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg articulated Tottenham's main issue against Frankfurt perfectly. He told BT Sport: \"We prepared well up until the 18-yard box, finding the spaces well to get in behind them. We needed to breathe and then put it in.\" Spurs played with much more spark, enthusiasm and bravery than in their 3-1 defeat to Arsenal on Saturday but the same underlying problem haunted their game. A lack of coolness. Heung-Min Son was the guiltiest party, making rash and rushed decisions either with his finishing or that killer last pass. Despite his tubthumping hat-trick against Leicester, it is not really happening for him this season. All three shots against Frankfurt failed to hit the target and although his first-half effort following a fantastic flick from Harry Kane was inches from finding the top corner it was still a rather snatched effort. As his team-mate Hojbjerg referenced, taking a breath may help the South Korean in those moments. Dejan Kulusevski is someone who is a master of taking care of that final ball and his hamstring injury issue is becoming a worry looking at the last 180 minutes of action that has only seen Spurs score from the penalty spot. They are usually a deadly clinical side but without the influence of their flying winger - whose assist record in the Premier League (11) is only bettered by Kevin De Bruyne since his debut on February 5 - Spurs are lacking the required guile.Lewis Jones A quick click in the comments under Tottenham's release of their team news for the clash with Frankfurt told you all you need to know about the general feeling regarding the selection of Emerson Royal. Twitter can be a less-than-reliable place to gauge such opinions from a fanbase but the amount of likes on negative reactions to the wing-back keeping his place spoke volumes. There was a bit of the straw that broke the camel's back about his needless sending off at Arsenal. Surely this would be the tipping point for his seemingly automatic place in Antonio Conte's first team after a prolonged spell of distinctly-average performances and his recent lack of discipline? With Matt Doherty and Djed Spence waiting in the wings and Royal set to miss the next three domestic games due to suspension, this looked to be a great opportunity to get his replacement up to speed. Yet, as Conte said in his press conference: \"Fans are fans.\" And he knows what he is doing. With that comment in mind, the Italian could have done with Royal being more influential than he was in the 0-0 with Frankfurt. He was by no means as sloppy as he can be but apart from an early dipping volley the game rather passed him by down the right flank. He was busy but failed to stamp any authority or class on the game. In a Conte system the wing-backs are so crucial to the creative output and there remains a strong feeling the presence of Royal is stunting the way Spurs construct attacks down that side, especially without Kulusevski. He will now be missing for the next three Premier League games and those in the Twitterati will get their wish of a Royal-free Spurs right-hand flank.Lewis Jones Even before the ball had been struck, there was a sense around Anfield that this was heading for the corner. Such is the confidence in Trent Alexander-Arnold when he has time to pick out his spot. He did just that for Liverpool's opener in their 2-0 win over Rangers. \"It was a wonderful goal,\" said Jurgen Klopp afterwards. \"I am happy that he still has that in his locker,\" he joked, referencing the wait since his last one. It was high quality and puts the focus back on his talent after all the speculation about his defensive deficiencies. And yet, maybe this is a dance that we are destined to do throughout his career. Liverpool's dominant display against Rangers did not test Alexander-Arnold too much defensively and it is on that aspect of the game that the criticism is focused. Did this tell us anything new? Maybe it did. Klopp decided to tweak his system for this game. Not because of Rangers, in particular, although he did acknowledge that the Scottish side's strength is the left side. Regardless of the opponent, Liverpool have been struggling to shut it down on that flank. \"We set it up differently,\" he explained. \"We take risks in defence, everyone knows that. It leaves gaps. Those gaps are behind Trent, but not because of him. That is why we adjusted slightly.\" More cover. The result? \"He played a good game, defensively especially.\" But it was that strike that showed why he is such a special player, one who can win games for one of the best teams in the world from full-back. He might have had an assist too had Virgil van Dijk not glanced his header wide. He left to a standing ovation. It was deserved.Adam Bate The £1,000,000 jackpot returns.

The German champions, unbeaten in the group stages since September 2017, remain top of Group C, extended their 100 per cent start this season to three matches and have yet to concede a goal. Leroy Sane struck twice for Julian Nagelsmann's side, who led 3-0 at half-time, while Serge Gnabry, former Liverpool forward Sadio Mane and Eric Choupo-Moting were also on target. Goals from Club Brugge forwards Kamal Sowah and Ferran Jutgla saw the Belgians beat Atletico Madrid 2-0 to extend their unbeaten run in Champions League Group B this season. The hosts took the lead in the 36th minute when Jutgla's low pass across the goal found Sowah, who tapped the ball into an empty net for his second European goal in three games. Jutgla doubled the lead in the 62nd minute after winger Tajon Buchanan calmly waited for the right moment to set up the Spaniard inside the box. Atletico had a chance to get back into the match with a penalty 15 minutes later but Antoine Griezmann lashed the ball against the bar and moments later the Frenchman thought he had scored but his effort was ruled out for offside. Trent Alexander-Arnold's free-kick and Mohamed Salah's penalty secured Liverpool a comfortable 2-0 win in their Champions League 'Battle of Britain' against Rangers.

Brazilian forward Galeno extended their lead in the 87th minute after his shot from inside the box found the net after taking a huge deflection off Leverkusen 'keeper Lukas Hradecky. Leverkusen striker Callum Hudson-Odoi put the ball in the net in the 15th minute from the edge of the six-yard box but his effort was chalked off after a VAR review found midfielder Robert Andrich had fouled Porto forward Pepe Aquino in the build-up.

US Soccer brought in former US Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and King & Spalding LLP a year ago to conduct an independent investigation after a report in The Athletic outlined allegations of abuse in the NWSL, prompting a reckoning across the league. The results of the Yates report, released on Monday, said abuse and sexual misconduct spanned multiple teams and coaches, and that the NWSL and US Soccer failed to put in \"basic measures\" to safeguard players or \"respond appropriately when confronted with player reports and evidence of abuse\". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  US Soccer said it would move swiftly to implement reforms. The NWSL said it would immediately review the findings of the inquiry. \"I think for so long this has fallen on the players to demand change,\" said Sauerbrunn, speaking to reporters from London, where the US are due to play European champions England in a friendly on Friday. \"That is because the people in authority and decision-making positions have repeatedly failed to protect us and they have failed to hold themselves and each other accountable. Who are you actually protecting and what values are you upholding? You have failed in your stewardship. \"Every owner and executive and US Soccer official who has repeatedly failed the players, failed to protect the players, hidden behind legalities and not participated in these investigations should be gone. \"At the bare minimum, the recommendations that are in the Sally Yates report should be immediately implemented by US Soccer and by the league.\" Friday's match was expected to be a joyous occasion for the four-time world champions, as they face England in front of a sold-out crowd at Wembley Stadium. Instead, the US players are putting on the jersey for a federation that failed to provide basic protection from abuse for players in the top-flight American professional league for years, according to the Yates report. \"The players are not doing well. We are horrified and heartbroken and frustrated and exhausted and really, really angry. We are angry that it took a third-party investigation,\" said Sauerbrunn. Alana Cook, who plays for OL Reign, added: \"I think we have such a momentous occasion on Friday, playing at a sold-out Wembley Stadium, and it's marred by this report and it's marred by the atrocities that have been condoned and tolerated and allowed to go on.\" After Wembley, the US travel to Pamplona to play Spain, a team embroiled in controversy of their own after the Spanish FA (RFEF) issued a statement last month that it received 15 emails from players saying their relationship with their coach was affecting their emotional state. Moments before Sauerbrunn met the media, Merritt Paulson, the owner and CEO of the Portland Thorns, said he would remove himself from \"Thorns-related decision making\" until a joint investigation between the NWSL and National Women's Soccer League Players Association (NWSLPA) is released. The Yates report said the Thorns organisation interfered with access to witnesses and \"raised specious legal arguments in an attempt to impede our use of relevant documents\". The report also said the club failed to make public accusations of abuse against a coach after terminating his contract in 2015 and that US Soccer and the NWSL did not stop him from coaching elsewhere despite being aware of the claims. \"Yesterday's Yates report unveiling was the darkest day I have experienced,\" Paulson said in a statement. \"I would imagine that it was even harder and darker for those whose stories were shared publicly.\" Chicago Red Stars owner Arnim Whisler, whom ignored complaints about inappropriate actions from coach Rory Dames last year, also stepped away from his role leading the team on Tuesday. Dames ultimately resigned last November. Whisler wrote in a statement: \"Our organization is committed to rebuilding trust and respect among players and staff towards our league and club, and I recognize that my current presence is a distraction. I do not want to take any of the attention away from the players' incredible and well earned playoff run. \"So in the interest of the club and the players, and fans we serve, effective immediately, I will remove myself from my governance role within the NWSL board of governors and will hand over operational control of the club to our executive team in Chicago.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  England international Rachel Daly said the women's football community \"stand in solidarity with the players\". \"I was saddened to see it [the report].

I extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims who lost their lives following this tragic incident. \"Together with FIFA and the global football community, all our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, those who have been injured, together with the people of the Republic of Indonesia, the Asian Football Confederation, the Indonesian Football Association, and the Indonesian Football League, at this difficult time.\" Indonesia's football association, known as PSSI, has suspended the premier league indefinitely in light of the tragedy and banned Arema from hosting matches for the rest of the season. Malang police chief Ferli Hidayat said there were some 42,000 spectators at Saturday's game, all of whom were Arema fans because the organiser had banned Persebaya fans from entering the stadium in an effort to avoid trouble.

Scott describes her father's violent behaviour towards her and her mother in her autobiography, and says she wishes she had spoken about it sooner. Her father, Tony, denied claims that he bullied and abused his daughter on Monday in a Daily Mail interview, insisting that he was strict - but not violent. Responding on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Scott said she had chosen to write about her father's behaviour because she wanted to help \"free my mum\". The 37-year-old said: \"I almost feel angry at myself that I'm allowing him to hurt me again by those claims of lying. \"This book, the reason was to get some peace. And I suppose when you are in peace it gives you a new position of power and that's maybe why he's trying to (respond) right now.\" In her autobiography, How (Not) to Be Strong, Scott details hearing her father being violent towards her mother while she and her brother were in bed in their flat in east London. She wrote: \"All I could do was lie there and pray my mum would be alive in the morning.\" On Radio 4, she said: \"(My mum) doesn't know that her two kids are in the room hearing everything. \"She's trying to be strong in a totally different way, we're trying to be strong for her but can't help her. The visuals are still so there. I couldn't do anything. \"It's all still so raw. I can visualise it like it was yesterday. Even when my dad left that environment, we never communicated or you don't speak about it. That pain and the struggles still continue.\" In his newspaper interview, Scott's father said: \"Perhaps she is judging me by today's standards, I don't know. \"Parents were a lot tougher back then. But I was never violent, that's just not me. I never beat Alex or anyone else in the family or did anything like that.\" Scott, in response, added: \"If you are saying being beaten with a belt is just being strict - I can take that, I really don't care about me. \"What I do care is about my mum and the fear and terror that she had to live in and the fact I was never able to help her in that. \"I feel sorry right now that I've not used my voice sooner to help my mum or any other woman that is in this position. But what he has done - he lit a new fire in me yesterday. \"What I will do is do all I can to help women in this position so they don't have the feelings that my mum has carried her whole life - or that I have.\" Scott has pledged that all the proceeds of her book will go to help women affected by domestic abuse.", "england-captain-leah-williamson-ruled-out-of-lionesses-games-against-usa-and-czech-republic": "England captain Leah Williamson has been ruled out of the games against USA and Czech Republic after sustaining an injury in training.

In a ruling issued on Tuesday, Judge Justice Steyn said Vardy must pay 90 per cent of Rooney's costs, and that £800,000 of the costs bill must be paid by 4pm on November 15. Vardy lost her libel trial against Rooney in July. The case centred around a social media post published by Rooney on October 9 2019, in which she accused Vardy of leaking stories about her to the press. The post led to Rooney being dubbed \"Wagatha Christie\" on social media - a nod to the world-famous British crime novelist Agatha Christie. Vardy, who had denied being responsible for leaking Rooney's personal information, announced she would be taking Rooney to court in June 2020, with the trial finally reaching the High Court in May this year. However, the case did not go Vardy's way, with the court finding the essence of Rooney's social media post was \"substantially true\" - that's to say Vardy was responsible for leaking Rooney's private information to the press. \n              'Wagatha Christie' explained\n             \n              What 'Wagatha Christie' case means for you\n             In her ruling, Judge Steyn said Rooney's evidence was \"honest and reliable\", but labelled Vardy's evidence \"manifestly inconsistent... evasive or implausible\".", "womens-euros-record-breaking-365m-people-watched-tournament": "A record-breaking 365m people around the globe watched the Women's Euros in the summer as England lifted the trophy.

The tournament ended as it began - with a record-breaking attendance. Wembley was packed with 87,192 spectators for the final between England and Germany, smashing the record set for the opening game as 68,871 people attended the Lionesses' win over Austria at Old Trafford.

The performance helped his side off bottom and put his World Cup chances back to the top of the agenda. Maddison has now scored nine goals in his last 11 Premier League appearances and says himself he is in the best form of his career. His manager Brendan Rodgers is backing his inclusion as he looks to add to the solitary England cap he won in 2019. Leicester's poor form might have masked the fact Maddison is thriving right now.

You see his talent and his performance level for the last 18 months is clear. I think it is only Harry Kane who has been involved in more goals among English players. \"To not even been in the squad, and I think to have a player even if he is not going to start but a player of that quality... and not only that, in international football it is the personality to take the ball and be creative to change the game. \n              Maddison inspires Leicester to win\n             \n              Rodgers: Maddison is perfect fit\n             \n              Maddison: I have to force my way in\n             \n              Premier League table\n             \"James is all of that. He is an absolutely brilliant player and I really hope over the next few months he can continue the form he has shown for the past 18 months and can somehow get into the team because if you want creativity, personality, he has improved the defensive side of his game, he can play in a couple of positions and for me, he is an absolutely outstanding player. \"He is up there, and I love Phil Foden, Mason Mount, those boys that play there. Jack Grealish is different as he is more from the side. But Madders can play in a number of positions to a high level. He showed that tonight.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Maddison himself discussed his England prospects on Monday Night Football, acknowledging the contrast between the team's form this season and his own. He said: \"It has been a bit of a weird position, to be honest, because we have been bottom of the league and results haven't gone our way, but I have almost been as confident as I have ever been in my career. \"I do not remember, over the last 12 months, playing better than I have and feeling better than I have.\" So, surely he is annoyed to be excluded from the England squad? \"It is hard to answer because you want to say the right thing and not the wrong thing, but that is an ambition of mine, a goal of mine. I am a football man, I watch international football and an opportunity at that level is something I desire and one I know I would have an impact at and one I hope will come my way at some point.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  One explanation for his continual omission from the squad is that there is not a natural position for him in Southgate's structure. Maddison is at his best floating between the lines, either as a No 10 or drifting in from the flanks, but does that role exist with England? \"I am not naïve, I know there are top players in those forward areas, but I have a self-belief and a confidence that I can be in that category,\" said Maddison. \"On the role and the position, [I could play] any of those forward areas. You see the likes of Phil (Foden) and Jack (Grealish) who can play in those central areas, play a little bit wider. \"It is hard to comment because I played on the right today, but England play slightly differently with the back three. I have not been in the set-up for a few years so I would have to listen to the coaches, but it is hard to talk about because it is not the position I am in right now. \"I will keep working hard, I have got to have the mindset of forcing my way in because those players at the big clubs are in at the minute and they are top players, but I think there could be a space for me. So I will keep working hard and producing performances like that tonight and see where it leads me.\" \"Everyone at this moment in time is wanting England to be more progressive and to score more goals and to have more attacking players in the team. This is the guy who is absolutely ripping it up at this moment in time in terms of his goal involvement. \"England usually need players who can deliver from set pieces and scores from them. Gareth Southgate has been big on that in the past four or five years but there are a few players in his position. \"The likes of Mason Mount, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden who play in those types of areas. But if you look at his numbers, why wouldn't he be in a 26-man squad? I know it's not a particularly comfortable question to ask if he'd be a good traveller, but that has been suggested. I don't know where it's come from. There's no substance to that from my side. I've seen nothing but a good personality, a good character. \"It's always willing to come out and answer questions. What is the reason why he wouldn't be in? I don't think it's a case of him coming in for Bukayo Saka or Jadon Sancho as for me they're wide players. I'd put him in the same category or where Mount is. \"A manager will go to the World Cup with the 3-4-3 system that he thinks he's going to play, but he has to think that he may have to go to a 4-3-3 at one point. \"He has to think the system may have to change to a 5-3-2 or whatever it might be. There has to be a Plan B for England. Gareth will have that, and if you need a goal from a knock-out game or you have a set piece or that little bit of quality, you want one like him on the bench who can change the game. \"There's a few who can but he's in the best form. Gareth has picked players before on form, and I don't know of any England manager who has picked players more irrespective of their club and he's always picked players on form. \"I know people will be screaming at the telly about Harry Maguire at the moment but the fact of the matter is, Harry Maguire has played well for England and we haven't got many centre-backs. It's as simple as that. We have got quite a few players in this position but James Maddison is in great form and we'll see what happens in the next few weeks.\" We asked Sky Sports readers whether they thought Maddison should be included in Southgate's squad for next month's tournament in Qatar - here are some of the responses: Adam: \"James Maddison should be picked in England's starting XI ahead of Mason Mount and Jack Grealish. We saw against Germany that Mount is better used off the bench, similarly to Bukayo Saka. The midfield options have to be Maddison, Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and possibly Mount, but Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford have to be back.\" Craig: \"Based on recent form, Maddison should be in the squad. For me, he doesn't start, though. If we play 3-5-2, as we suspect Gareth Southgate will, he can't really start ahead of Rice or Bellingham and I don't think he can displace the front three. He's a great option from the bench.\" Shicket: \"If you look at Southgate's squad, all the attacking players play as inverted wingers - there's no room for a No 10 in a 5-2-3. Surely we need a different way to beat the full-back if inverted wingers aren't working? Sancho or Jack Harrison are probably best at beating full-backs on the outside.\" Joe: \"Maddison should not be in the England squad because Southgate hasn't even picked Rashford or Sancho, who are on form, unlike some of the players that have been picked for the squad.\" Glyn Morgan: \"Southgate's squad will be made up of 10 defenders, four holders, three goalkeepers and nine forward-thinking players. Given Trent Alexander-Arnold won't get in as a defender or a holder - and the clamour will be for him to get him in - can we fit both Maddison and Alexander-Arnold into one of those nine remaining spots?\" Super 6 is back, bigger and better than ever with a £250,000 jackpot.

There's no doubt if there were another three or four top-class centre-backs behind him in the same way Trent Alexander-Arnold is competing with the full-backs then he wouldn't be in the team, but they haven't got that at this moment in time. \"I remember seeing a psychologist the season we missed the FA Cup after winning the treble because we were in the inaugural Club World Cup. There was a massive noise over in this country because we went over to Brazil and I made two mistakes against Vasco da Gama. I went from being on top of the world to feeling massively under pressure to the point where for the next four or five months I was shocking.

I think perspective is a really important thing as a footballer. All of them are going to have bad moments and these things happen.

Carragher said: \"I thought the criticism Gareth Southgate got for playing him because he hasn't been playing for Manchester United, I thought was absolute nonsense. He's been England's best centre-back just through his performances in the last two tournaments. He was in the team of the tournament in the last Euros. Southgate had to pick him just to see where he was at, and where he was fitness-wise. \"I had no problem with him being picked in the game but they obviously didn't go well and that is a big worry as he doesn't normally perform like that for England. But he performed poorly off the back of not playing for United. Gareth had to find that out for himself but what it has done is it's created a big problem. I don't think England can go into a World Cup now if Maguire is not playing for United. \"I don't think you can go into a tournament where you're facing the best players in the world. You have to think about Maguire's mental state, where he is confidence wise. I think the criticism he gets is over the top and it's a bit bullying. It's got to that stage, certainly on social media, ridiculing the lad for what he's done - especially in an England shirt. \"John Terry and Rio Ferdinand were two of the best centre-backs in the Premier League but they still never achieved what Harry Maguire has in an England shirt in terms of getting to a semi-final of a World Cup and the final of a Euros. \"I know it's a team game, and Maguire isn't as good as those players, but in an England shirt he's achieved a lot. It makes it very difficult for him to start in a World Cup if he's not playing for England.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  On Southgate's own future, Nevile said: \"I would only say it's the end of an era if it feels like a natural end for Gareth in the sense that he's taken it as far as he can and achieved unbelievable things. \"If you said to me that Gareth Southgate was going to take us to the tournament beyond this one, I'd have no problem with it whatsoever. In fact, I'd say he deserves it. Even if England don't have a good tournament, he deserves it for what he's done previously. A final? A semi-final? It's unbelievable what he's achieved. \"Maybe it's not enough for some people it may not be enough, but for me who sees England as their biggest disappointment in their football career and post-football career, I think it's absolutely unbelievable what he's achieved and what these players have achieved is remarkable. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"I'm proud of every single one of these players for England. They've absolutely performed well above anything I would ever have expected. \"When they go to the semi-final in Russia, I thought they'd struggle to get there again because Croatia in the semi-final was an unbelievable opportunity. But to get to a final in the Euros was amazing and beating Germany at Wembley. \"I wouldn't say Gareth has done enough to choose his time to go, but with the FA and the relationship they have, they will say to him 'what do you want to do after this tournament?'. Gareth is smart enough to know when the time is coming because when the tide turns with England and the media turn, it can be the case a little bit that your time is up. But I don't think that is the case at all.\" Carragher added: \"It was a lot of idiots who were speaking about Gareth Southgate [to be sacked] and speaking about how well we've had it before. It was awful before, let's be honest, and what Gareth Southgate has done and where we were when he came in. \"It doesn't mean you get grace forever, but England managers should only be judged on tournaments. Forget qualification, we beat a big team in a friendly - I don't care one bit. I don't really care about the Nations League. \"What has Gareth Southgate done in tournaments? We're a big enough nation where you judge England on tournaments. I don't ever expect to go to a tournament and for England to win - that's obvious because of our record - but what he's done in tournaments is close to matching Sir Alf Ramsey. \"There's also this idea that Gareth Southgate is holding this squad back. it's absolute rubbish. This squad is not better than the squads we played in, it's not better than Euro 96 or 1990. It's a very good England squad, and we usually do have a good squad, and we're normally just short of the best teams in the world. \"Gareth has got closer than anyone before, but the idea that he's holding us back is rubbish. \"In terms of Qatar, if I was Gareth, I'd be looking at the way the feeling has been over the last few weeks and if England don't get to semi-final or final now… If I was Gareth Southgate, I'd walk away after Qatar. No matter how it goes, you can just feel it turning. \"Sometimes it's boredom, it's like being a club manager for five or six years, but as soon as it goes a little bit, you want something new and fresh. So if I was Gareth Southgate, I'd leave after Qatar.\" Despite the uncertainty surrounding Maguire's position in the England side, Neville feels there is plenty of grounds for optimism heading into the World Cup after Southgate's side showed character to come back and avoid defeat in their last outing. \"I really enjoyed the England vs Germany game,\" he continued on the Gary Neville podcast. \"I was really happy for Gareth in the second half and that response. There were four Nations League games in the summer and then two here, those four were a bit of a joke. I don't think anyone wanted football at that point in the year. \"The fans didn't want them, the players didn't want them, the coaches didn't want them. Ahead of a long season and the World Cup, it wasn't right. I switched off myself from England in the summer. And the players did. \"Gareth is suffering a little bit in terms of how they're doing and the run-up to the World Cup. It's dangerous to say it, I don't feel like that. Where those players have got to, who have got to World Cup semi-final and the Euros finals, you get to those Nations League games and it's a massive come down. \"I just think they've switched off - I don't think we or Gareth should condone that because there's 90,000 fans turning up for games sometimes and thousands of England fans travelling abroad spending lots of money. You can't say that's good enough and it's not, \"But I get it a little bit, especially when you have people like Kevin De Bruyne speaking out against this tournament in the summer. I don't really get the Nations League, it was quite good in the early years when it replaced friendlies but it suffered badly because of the World Cup and it's taken a battering. \"I remain as confident of World Cup success as an England fan, going into the tournament. Because I've seen here today (Phil) Foden and (Jack) Grealish. And (Harry) Kane yesterday in a disappointing Tottenham game. And I saw (Bukayo) Saka and players like Ben White. We've got some pretty good players.\" Neville said: \"We've got a couple of issues but we have some good players who are going to cause a lot of very good teams problems. Kalvin Phillips is touch and go and I love Jude Bellingham. \"I loved watching Bellingham in England vs Germany. I used to watch Bryan Robson driving the team forward in difficult situations. Bellingham did that, he was absolutely outstanding. There will be an avalanche of enquiries from the Premier League soon, if not already. \"That Rice-Bellingham pivot looked ok but it might leave England a little bit open. I do want to see Bellingham in the team somewhere so I don't know how that's going to work. But you saw the quality of Mount coming on the other night and you see the players we have, I'm still encouraged by England and Gareth. \"They've got it right in the last two tournaments and they know how to get it right. What we've seen in the Nations League, it's not them. Their CV is not that, it's better than that. I think they'll switch it on. They'll get there to the World Cup and go 'here we are, here we go'.

There is absolutely no time. The players will be fit and ready. \"We've complained for years about summer tournaments and being knackered at the end of the season and the Premier League suffers more than most. We have no excuses. Qatar will be 20 to 21 degrees, it won't be too hot. The time difference is just a couple of hours so it won't be a problem. The stadiums are excellent, I've been over there. I understand the controversy about building them and I abhor that and we can discuss that in a separate conversation. \"However, England's players should be hitting peak. I remember when I was playing in October, November and December and going: 'I'm going through the English winter and I'm flying'. You get to May and June the year after and you're flagging. \"I still remain really optimistic. There's a lot of pessimism and it was far too much. I'm all for pessimism at the right time but there was too much for Gareth, too much for the team and I didn't feel the depression and deflation that others have felt. Am I missing something? \"I don't see an outstanding candidate to take over from Southgate at this time.\" Super 6 is back, bigger and better than ever with a £250,000 jackpot.

Last week, Jurgen Klopp launched an impassioned defence of his right-back, whose World Cup hopes appear to be hanging by a thread, but accepts England manager Gareth Southgate has a different way of playing. The 23-year-old was called up for the two Nations League matches against Italy and Germany but was an unused substitute for one and failed to make the squad for the second. There has been a long-running debate as to why he cannot fit into the international side, with his apparent defensive deficiencies putting him behind Manchester City's Kyle Walker, Chelsea's Reece James and Newcastle's Kieran Trippier. These were exposed once more by Brighton during Saturday's 3-3 draw at Anfield - and Neville believes the imbalance in his game must be addressed... I watched the goals against Brighton and there was a big conversation in Jurgen Klopp's press conference about Trent Alexander-Arnold. Klopp defended him but I feel he was involved in all three Brighton goals on Saturday. I've wanted to do a piece on Alexander-Arnold on Monday Night Football for a long time. Trent isn't a young player any more. He's young in his age but he's actually got 250 matches for Liverpool and England. That's a mountain of games to have. \n              Merson Says: Why can't Liverpool defend? Because they sold Mane\n             \n              Klopp: Liverpool need to go back to basics\n             \n              Liverpool 3-3 Brighton: Match report and highlights\n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             What does surprise me still when I watch him is three or four of the very basic things in full-back play... These things can be taught in training and be coached every day because I was a poor full-back at the age of 20. What we know now is that you cannot be a full-back in the modern game without having the ability to go forward. It's near-on impossible. There's an expectation now that you are good on the ball going forward. That's why we don't see Aaron Wan-Bissaka playing under Erik ten Hag at Manchester United. He's not deemed as capable enough in setting up play and taking the ball into the final third. You can no longer sit here and say, 'defending is his priority, defending is his first job'. But the balance between being a good defender and a good attacker is imperative. You can't be 70-80 per cent attacker and only 10-20 per cent defender when you are a full-back. What Trent has at the moment is an imbalance in his game. You can have a brilliant attacking part of his game like he has, and a less competent defensive part but it needs to be one that gets you through moments in games and you have to be capable of dealing with things. I think Trent has to work on his defending. I said it a few years ago that there was a lack of seriousness in his defending and there was a lack of alertness. At some point in his career, it will hold him back. If Liverpool aren't in as good a period as they have been for four or five years - which is what they are at the moment - or he plays for a less superior team in possession like England, then there's going to be a greater expectation that he is going to be in a defensive position for more of the game. That's what we are seeing at the moment. It's causing him some pain and he's only young. But it's an important juncture in his career where it's not a time to wade into him, it's not a time to give up on him. It's a time to get right behind him as he's one of the most exceptional talents that you will ever see as a full-back on the ball. During my Premier League career at United, I played 400 games and had 35 assists. He's had 44 assists in his last four seasons at the age of 23. It's absolutely ridiculous. What we have got here is one of the great talents this country has produced in this position. But, I think there's an example in his own team where the balance is right in Andrew Robertson. He goes forward, gets plenty of assists, lots of passes into his strikers and lots of good play into midfield but also he's competitive and he's good down that side in terms of his defending. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  I remember in the early parts of my career when I was a centre-back - I wasn't very good as a one-on-one defender and I was actually hopeless going forward with the ball for the first two or three years at United. What I recognised was that I had to start by getting 'bright on my feet' as a defender. Get low and get jockeying. I used to see Bryan 'Pop' Robson - who was a player at West Ham - in the summer. He had done some work with Steve Howey at the time, and I remember these jockeying exercises where I'd need to get low and twist from side to side. He used to say things to me such as, 'a dog never turns its back'. The rest of lads used to laugh at me and Phil. It built an alertness in our defending. Trent is very upright when he defends. I had to learn to become a one-on-one defender where you need to get out to people quickly. Being able to shift your feet quickly is a key part of defending. Don Howe then taught me about being alert when the ball is on the opposite side of the pitch. He was the best defensive coach I have ever seen at coaching a full-back when the ball wasn't near you. His view was that full-backs were pretty good at defending when the ball is on their side. The problems full-backs mainly have is when the ball isn't near them but in central areas or on the other side. Being able to swivel your head and judge the distances - these are the things I worked on for two or three years which made me into a pretty decent defensive full-back. I was watching these other players like Roberto Carlos, Paulo Maldini and Cafu in European football who were going forward and scoring goals. I then saw Dennis Irwin on the other side of the pitch contributing by scoring free-kicks and I thought, 'I'm really basic'. So I started working on my crossing with Jim Ryan [Man Utd youth team coach] when I was in the first team. I would go out and work on my channel ball into the striker's feet. A good channel ball is also a good cross. I was putting pressure on myself thinking in the final third, a cross was something special. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But I started to think about slowing myself down and practising 50 times each afternoon having longer or slower strides and whipping the ball into the box. It took me until about 26-27 before I felt I became a pretty decent attacking full-back, where I overlapped and put crosses in the box of real quality. Trent is going to have to do it in reverse. I learned to be a defender first, but Trent has all the attacking attributes. You can develop your game and you can work on these things. I have been there where you are in a wide area and you feel exposed. He gets no support from Mo Salah outside him in terms of defensive work. I would get it sometimes from the likes of Darren Fletcher, David Beckham or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer if he was playing on the right. Not so much Cristiano Ronaldo! But Beckham and Fletcher would work like dogs for me to give me that protection. I don't feel Trent gets that at Liverpool. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He made a couple of mistakes against Brighton but the biggest issue for Liverpool isn't Trent Alexander-Arnold. There's always a focal point but Virgil van Dijk is not playing at his absolute best while the sale of Sadio Mane is causing a problem. Injuries in midfield have also caused them a problem and maybe they should have signed a world-class midfielder in the summer. I also feel they have been punching well above their weight. They have got an exceptional manager, a wonderful team spirit married with the crowd all coming together. They've had an outstanding time but when you look at their net spend compared to these two clubs today [Man City and Man Utd], they are competing with both hands tied behind their back. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Liverpool fans may start to think they need to be spending at the same rate as the other clubs - like Chelsea have done this summer - but if I was Liverpool I would not be panicking too much. They have still got the best-performing manager in this league over the last four or five years with what he's done given the spending. At the moment, it's not right as we are not seeing that ferocious press but they have built up too much credit in my view to stick the knife in at this point where it would be too early. Liverpool fans and Klopp will be worried, and there will be some disappointment at the level they are at now - which is miles off the level of Manchester City at present. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Are they going to compete this year for the title? Probably not. You never know because Klopp can do the exceptional and he has surprised us by staying on the coat-tails. They pushed them right to the end last season but they had no right to. Darwin Nunez needs to settle in and they need to get back to the levels they have set. Speaking on Monday Night Football, Jamie Carragher reflected on the problem Liverpool have with starting games slowly, with Klopp's team currently sitting bottom of the table for points won based on the first-half score lines alone. \"It's a huge concern,\" Carragher told Sky Sports. \"They are always giving themselves so much to do. They have not lost too many of those games, so it's not an attitude problem. \"They've managed to get back into games. In the past we have spoken about Liverpool conceding goals because of a high line but for me a big problem right now is the midfield. \"Teams are coming through and getting at that back four far too easily - and also early in games, hence the poor starts. Brighton were 2-0 up but I think it's fair to say it should've been 4-0 after 20 minutes because Liverpool are not organised and not difficult to beat as they always were. \"Klopp's thing was always to make Liverpool the hardest to play against - right now, they look the easiest team to play against. Some of what we saw in the first half against Brighton you would have expected later in games if Liverpool were chasing them. \"Every supporter in the summer would tell you they felt midfield would be a problem this season. Fabinho has been miles off the pace from what he's been this season. There have been times where they have been lucky in situations.\" Super 6 is back, bigger and better than ever with a £250,000 jackpot.

US Soccer said it would move immediately to implement reforms. NWSL was forced into a reckoning a year ago as a report from The Athletic outlined allegations of sexual abuse by former North Carolina Courage head coach Paul Riley, after speaking to more than a dozen players he had coached since 2010. The Athletic said Riley denied \"the majority\" of the allegations. The fallout engulfed the league, prompting the departure of former commissioner Lisa Baird and demands for reform, while half of the NWSL teams parted ways with their head coaches over player complaints before the end of the 2021 season. US Soccer brought on Sally Q. Yates and King & Spalding LLP to conduct the independent inquiry and released the full findings. \"Our investigation has revealed a league in which abuse and misconduct - verbal and emotional abuse and sexual misconduct - had become systemic, spanning multiple teams, coaches, and victims,\" the Yates' report said. \"The verbal and emotional abuse players describe in the NWSL is not merely 'tough' coaching. And the players affected are not shrinking violets. They are among the best athletes in the world.\" The report made numerous recommendations to prioritise player health and safety. Among them is the requirement that teams accurately disclose coach misconduct to the league and the soccer federation to ensure coaches aren't allowed to move between teams. It also calls for meaningful vetting of coaches and timely investigation into allegations of abuse. US Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone called the investigation's findings \"heartbreaking and deeply troubling.\" She said: \"I found the whole report challenging to read. Obviously, this is near and dear to my heart. I've been a part of this game all my life, from the youth all the way up to the professional level and an international level, so the women's game is really important to me. \"And many of the players in this report I know. Many of them I coached. I found the whole report shocking. I just found it really maddening that players had to go through this.\" The NWSL said it would immediately review the findings. A joint investigation between the league and its players' association is ongoing. \"We greatly appreciate our players, staff and stakeholders' cooperation with both investigations, especially during the ongoing season,\" the league said in a statement. \"We recognise the anxiety and mental strain that these pending investigations have caused and the trauma that many including players and staff are having to relive.\" A joint statement from former NWSL players Sinead Farrelly, Mana Shim and Erin Simon, who currently plays for Leicester City said: \"There have been too many years of inaction and too many empty promises made while players suffered at the hands of the league. No one involved has taken any responsibility for the clear role they played in harming players - not the teams, not the league, and not the federation. They chose to ignore us and silence us, allowing the abuse to continue. \"It is time for action, accountability, and change. Owners who have driven a culture of disrespect, who are complicit in abusing their own players, have no place in this league and should be removed from governance immediately.

I extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims who lost their lives following this tragic incident. \"Together with FIFA and the global football community, all our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, those who have been injured, together with the people of the Republic of Indonesia, the Asian Football Confederation, the Indonesian Football Association, and the Indonesian Football League, at this difficult time.\" Indonesia's football association, known as PSSI, has suspended the premier league indefinitely in light of the tragedy and banned Arema from hosting matches for the rest of the season. Malang police chief Ferli Hidayat said there were some 42,000 spectators at Saturday's game, all of whom were Arema fans because the organiser had banned Persebaya fans from entering the stadium in an effort to avoid trouble. Hooliganism is rife in the football-obsessed Indonesia where fanaticism often ends in violence, highlighted by the 2018 death of a Persija Jakarta supporter who was killed by a mob of hardcore fans from rival club Persib Bandung.", "england-world-cup-squad-ladder-jack-grealish-on-the-plane-after-manchester-derby-display-callum-wilson-a-new-entry": "It was a good weekend for Jack Grealish and Conor Gallagher but Trent Alexander-Arnold's slide continues. The Sky Sports England World Cup squad ladder returns as we chart the latest risers and fallers! Gareth Southgate is expected to announce his 26-man squad for Qatar 2022 on October 20 and there are a host of players hoping to catch his eye and secure their place on the plane. Jack Grealish's excellent performance in the Manchester derby has put him in that group, joining team-mate and hat-trick hero Phil Foden, and he is not the only player on the move. Here, we run through the players on the plane, those sitting in the departure lounge with their boarding passes in hand, and those jumping in a taxi to the airport and hoping for the best. Remember, we will be updating our ladder every week ahead of Southgate's announcement. Jack Grealish endured a difficult first season at Manchester City following his £100m switch from Aston Villa last summer but his eye-catching display at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday provided further evidence that he is hitting top form. Grealish did not register any goals or assists in the 6-3 win, but he was involved in many of City's best moments and caused Manchester United huge problems, his performance moving him up from 14th to 12th in our ladder and taking him from departure lounge to the plane. Southgate has always been a big supporter of the 27-year-old and a strong run for City, for whom he has just started four consecutive games for the first time since December, could help him nail down his place in the England team to face Iran on November 21. \n              England fixtures\n             \n              Find out more about Sky Sports\n             \n              Premier League table \n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             \n              Live football on Sky Sports this week\n             Grealish's team-mate Phil Foden (5th) also climbed a couple of places following his sensational hat-trick against United, while Bukayo Saka (8th) moved above Mason Mount (9th) after helping Arsenal beat Tottenham 3-1 on Saturday. Harry Kane (1st) continues to lead the pack having scored his seventh goal of the season in Tottenham's defeat to Arsenal, while Manchester United duo Luke Shaw (13th) and Harry Maguire (14th) remain on the plane for now due to their importance to Southgate. John Stones, another Southgate favourite, remains 10th given he is only expected to be sidelined for a couple of weeks with the hamstring injury that kept him out of the Manchester derby. He was only on the pitch for 14 minutes against Crystal Palace but Chelsea's Conor Gallagher's brilliant winner at Selhurst Park has seen him climb seven places to 26th, putting him in the departure lounge and boosting his World Cup prospects. The 22-year-old will need to build on that contribution in the weeks ahead if he is to stay there but there is uncertainty in England's midfield and he could capitalise. Kalvin Phillips (22nd) remains a doubt due to injury, while James Ward-Prowse's (25th) form has been middling for Southampton. Gallagher has various factors in his favour. He is already known to Southgate having been picked in two of his last three squads. His stamina and industry could be useful in the condensed schedule of a major tournament. Gallagher can also slot into different roles in midfield. He played as a No 8 for Palace last season but came on at No 10 for Chelsea on Saturday. After a slow start to the season under Thomas Tuchel, he now has the chance to establish himself in the Chelsea team under Graham Potter. If he does, Southgate is sure to take notice. Elsewhere in the departure lounge, Jarrod Bowen (24th) has climbed a couple of places after scoring his first goal of the season in West Ham's 2-0 win over Wolves on Saturday, while Kieran Trippier (15th) has jumped above Jordan Henderson (16th) and Kyle Walker (17th) following another assured display for Newcastle in their 4-1 win at Fulham. Marcus Rashford looked to be in the ascendency before this weekend but a poor showing in the Manchester derby has seen him drop two places to 27th, taking him from the departure lounge to a taxi hoping to arrive at the airport on time. There is a new entry hot on his heels in Callum Wilson. The Newcastle striker has entered the ladder in position 28 having marked his return from injury with a goal against Fulham on Saturday. The 30-year-old must prove his sharpness in the weeks ahead but he has already won four caps under Southgate and, with 11 goals in 22 Premier League appearances since the start of last season, he is averaging a goal every 155 minutes. It is a better strike-rate than Harry Kane, who has averaged a goal every 164 minutes in the same timeframe, and it underlines a level of efficiency that is sure to make him appealing to Southgate. Wilson is still behind Tammy Abraham (23rd) in the ladder, but the Roma striker has only scored twice in eight games for the Serie A side this season and could be at risk if Wilson continues to impress between now and the squad announcement. Wilson already looks a more likely pick than Brentford's Ivan Toney (33rd), who did not make it on the pitch following his England call-up during the recent international break. He has dropped three places in our ladder after failing to find the net against Bournemouth. Trent Alexander-Arnold (31st) is another player whose hopes are diminishing. The right-back was publicly backed by Jurgen Klopp last week but another poor defensive display in Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Brighton, during which he was at fault for two goals, will have done little to boost his prospects. In fact, he has dropped a further four places in our ladder. Arsenal's Emile Smith Rowe is the man to have dropped out of the 40, the 22-year-old expected to be unavailable for World Cup selection having undergone surgery on a groin problem. Check back next week to see which players have boosted their chances of a World Cup call-up - and which players are drifting out of contention.

Here is how you can watch Championship matches across Sky Sports this season. Chris Wilder's sacking by Middlesbrough on Monday means eight of the 24 clubs in the second tier have either sacked or seen their boss depart since the start of the season. By the same stage in the last two campaigns there had been just one. There was also a summer of upheaval in the Championship, with seven clubs changing managers following the end of last season. Two, Watford and Huddersfield, have since sacked their off-season appointment. May 23: Watford appoint Rob Edwards on following the expiry of Roy Hodgson's contract after their relegation from the Premier League.\n\n\nJune 1: QPR appoint Michael Beale after Mark Warburton's contract expires.\n\n\nJune 14: Blackburn appoint Jon Dahl Tomasson following the expiry of Tony Mowbray's contract.\n\n\nJune 14: Burnley appoint Vincent Kompany following the end of Mike Jackson's caretaker spell.\n\n\nJune 17: Blackpool appoint Michael Appleton after Neil Critchley joins Aston Villa's coaching staff.\n\n\nJuly 3: Birmingham appoint John Eustace after the sacking of Lee Bowyer.\n\n\nJuly 7: Huddersfield appoint Danny Schofield following the resignation of Carlos Corberan.\n The first managerial departure of the season came at Stoke City on August 25, when the Potters parted company with Michael O'Neill after just one win in their first five games. He had been in charge for nearly three years, having joined in November 2019. His departure led to Stoke moving for Sunderland boss Alex Neil, who was hired three days later. Two days after that, the Black Cats brought in Tony Mowbray. It is yet to really pay off for Stoke. Neil has just one win from five so far, while Sunderland have picked up eight points in the intervening time, and sit nine places higher in the Championship table. Huddersfield were just 90 minutes away from the Premier League in May, after a fantastic run to the play-off final. But Carlos Corberan resigned in July, and was replaced from within by Danny Schofield. \n              Championship table\n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Championship fixtures\n             \n              Get NOW to stream big moments\n             \"Danny Schofield will now step up to lead the team,\" said head of football operations Leigh Bromby. \"He knows the club, the players, our coaching programme, and our structure as well as anyone and is ideally positioned to give us continuity.\" That 'continuity' would last just nine games. Just one win and a draw in that time brought an end to his time at the club on September 14. A fortnight later, Huddersfield appointed Mark Fotheringham, but his tenure began on Saturday with a 3-1 defeat at Reading. Steve Morison had been brought in as caretaker manager of Cardiff after the sacking of Mick McCarthy last October. He was then given the job on a permanent basis in November until the end of the season after impressing, before being given a year extension until the summer of 2023 in March. Tasked with an overhaul of the club's squad and playing style over the summer, including the arrival of 17 new signings, Morison lasted just 10 games, being sacked on September 18 off the back of three wins and two draws with the club in 18th. Cardiff are yet to appoint a replacement. Rotherham have been relegated in their last two Championship campaigns under Paul Warne, but things had started very brightly this season, with just one defeat in their first nine games. However, his impressive record in League One and his good start drew the attention of Derby County, who are trying to force their way out of the third tier and managed to lure Warne to Pride Park to replace interim boss Liam Rosenior on September 22. It would have come as a real blow to the Millers in their attempts to survive in the Championship for the first time since 2016. Matt Taylor was brought in from Exeter on Tuesday to try and help maintain their second-tier status. \"We will be supporting Rob Edwards come hell or high water. We believe that he will deliver what we all want - sustained and successful Premier League football.\" That was the statement from Watford when they brought Edwards in from Forest Green in June. That backing would last just 11 Championship matches and three months at the helm on September 26. Edwards was their 17th permanent manager in 10 years under the ownership of Gino Pozzo. On the same day, Slaven Bilic became their 18th. The Croatian - who took West Brom to the Premier League in 2020 - started well, however, winning 4-0 at Stoke in his first game on Sunday. One of the first acts of Acun Ilicali following his takeover at Hull City in January was to sack Grant McCann and appoint Shota Arveladze as his new manager - despite the fact McCann had brought the club up from League One and was on his way to consolidating the club back in the Championship. Hull started this season well after a summer recruitment drive, winning three and drawing two of their first six games. But four defeats on the bounce, with just a single goal scored, brought Arveladze's time at the club to an end on September 30. He was, quite, bizarrely, sacked on the morning of a game last Friday. Although his departure did not help Hull, as they were beaten 2-0 at home by Luton. The Tigers are still on the hunt for a new manager. There was huge fanfare on Teesside when Middlesbrough appointed Chris Wilder last November to replace Neil Warnock. The man who had taken Sheffield United from League One to the Premier League was seen as a major coup by the club, but they narrowly missed out on the play-offs last season - finishing seventh in the table and five points behind Luton in sixth. This season Boro were supposed to kick on, after Wilder had the summer to implement his unique playing style, but it never quite gelled and just two wins from 11 games has left the club in the bottom three and Boro on the lookout for a new boss.

The France international, who can also play in midfield, signed a two-year extension on his contract earlier this year taking him to 2026 - but significantly it contained a €60m (£52.4m) release clause which kicks in next summer. Sky Sports News has been told nothing has been signed and the player himself has yet to make a final decision on his future amid interest from a number of top European clubs. It is thought Chelsea are prepared to offer more than the release clause in advance of the summer to ensure they get Nkunku ahead of the other interested clubs.

Since then his team have disintegrated and he finds himself out of a job. One win in 15 games reflects that dramatic decline. It is not just that they are the lowest scorers in the Premier League this season. It is the fact that they have scored fewer goals than Burnley since April - and Burnley were relegated in May. Lage has failed to achieve his goals with a team that does not score them. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Although there were boos and chants towards the end of the 2-0 defeat to West Ham on Saturday evening, the majority of Wolves supporters retained some hope that the results would turn. Many believed that the talent within the team would win out. Lage's name was chanted loudly and often in his final two home games and cannot point to a lack of support. Even Dean Saunders and Stale Solbakken had a better record in their final 15 games. Whatever league you are in, that is bound to sour the mood a little. But events in London felt like an ending, a manager who had lost his way. Ruben Neves, Wolves' best player, out of position in defence. The diminutive Daniel Podence up front. Nelson Semedo on the wing. A team not set up to play to their own strengths. There had been optimism in the summer. Lage was backed like never before even if that investment was imbalanced. Matheus Nunes, a £38m signing from Sporting, looks a fine prospect. Goncalo Guedes came with a big reputation and a big fee at £27.5m. \n              Premier League table \n             \n              Premier League fixtures\n             \n              Get Sky Sports\n             \n              Download the Sky Sports App\n             Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But Nunes is not a goalscoring midfielder and Guedes is still waiting for his first Wolves goal after eight underwhelming appearances. The game is decided in both boxes and it is there that the decision-making has been questionable both on the pitch and off it. It is worth starting where everyone else will - with that widely-criticised call of allowing captain Conor Coady to leave on loan to Everton. It was a move that sparked a reaction of bewilderment at the time and has looked more inexplicable with each passing week. In truth, there was some logic there. The fee for Coady will likely edge beyond £12m for a player who turns 30 in February. Signing 21-year-old Nathan Collins as his replacement made some business sense and there is hope that he can develop into a real asset. But even leaving aside Coady's leadership qualities, the sight of him thriving in a back four - the system he was deemed unsuitable for - has been embarrassing. Collins' red card against Manchester City and subsequent three-match suspension left Wolves exposed. The sale of Willy Boly coupled with a lack of trust in young back-up options Toti Gomes and Yerson Mosquera persuaded Lage to put Neves there. Such is the Portuguese's talent, he did a perfectly passable job but the optics of it are miserable and point to poor planning. And yet, all that is a mere distraction given the problems at the other end of the pitch. After all, Wolves went into the Manchester City game last time out at Molineux with the best defensive record in the Premier League. It is a lack of goals that has cost Lage. Three in eight this season. Ten in 16 since April. The result is that when Wolves fall behind - as they did in the first half against West Ham and in the first minute against Manchester City - the prospect of finding a way back into the game appears needlessly remote. Here too, a controversial loan decision has been criticised. Fabio Silva has scored more goals since being lent to Anderlecht than Wolves have managed as a team without him. At least that decision feels like the right move for the youngster's development. But it has still been somewhat jarring to listen to Lage talk of how his team is completely different with a striker. That would appear to be a belated realisation given that Wolves left it until deadline day to supplement the out-of-form and injured Raul Jimenez in attack. Guedes played centrally for Valencia but is now not seen as an option there. Sasa Kalajdzic had a reputation for being injury-prone and duly broke down on debut following his £15.4m arrival. If Diego Costa was really a viable option why did Wolves look elsewhere first? Perhaps those are questions for technical director Scott Sellars and chairman Jeff Shi. For Lage, this is someone else's problem now. The hope for Wolves is that his departure sparks an upturn in form, that a new voice in the dressing room will be a welcome one. Given that Lage experienced a similar dip at Benfica - winning the title in spectacular fashion before an incongruous run of two wins from 12 saw him sacked - it is fair to ask whether his penchant for long meetings can have a wearying effect on his players. That is not to say Lage was unpopular. It is true that he never replicated the bond with supporters enjoyed by Nuno Espirito Santo, the man who took Wolves from the Championship to Europe. There were no fist-pump celebrations for fans to engage with. But he was a popular figure around the club, more personable than his predecessor. Many of the players welcomed his willingness to discuss ideas. In the end, the impression was that he had run out of them. His successor will need to find the solutions. It could be that the correction comes quickly. Costa showed promise on his debut, while Collins and Neves will return from suspension ahead of a home game against Nottingham Forest. A win over their fellow strugglers could lift Wolves out of the relegation zone. Even with an imbalanced squad, this is a talented group of players. Lage is likely to be left wondering whether he could have turned things around given more games.

With the FIA mulling the penalties, Red Bull defending their case, and rival teams angry, it's an F1 saga that is set to continue - and Sky Sports has you covered with the answers to the key questions... After weeks of speculation, the FIA ruled last Monday that Red Bull were guilty of a 'minor' breach of F1's cost cap, which debuted in 2021 to level the playing field and limit teams to spending a maximum of $145m per year. The word 'minor' means the team overstepped last year's cap by less than five per cent ($7.25m). Aston Martin, who were previously rumoured to have also overspent, only committed a 'procedural' breach, which is related to filling out forms incorrectly - the same as Williams earlier this year. All seven other teams were issued with certificates of compliance. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The FIA has not disclosed how much Red Bull went over the budget cap. In theory, therefore, it could be a matter of thousands, or up to that $7.25m mark. It has been reported that Red Bull have not exceeded the limit by more than $2m, which is much less than rival teams were suggesting back at the Singapore GP. That, though, is all speculation until the FIA discloses more details. Like the figure above, the punishment is another key detail we just do not know, and a sporting infringement is not a black-and-white penalty like breaching the sport's technical regulations. But we do know what the punishments could be. It depends on just how much an F1 team overspent, but $7m is a hugely significant sum of money even to the larger teams, while even $2m would be enough for a crucial upgrade and potentially tenths of seconds. The potential consequences for a 'minor' breach are a financial penalty and/or minor sporting penalty, and are as follows: The FIA has said it is \"currently determining the appropriate course of action to be taken\", and the likely first choice would be for an 'accepted breach agreement' to be reached between Red Bull and the cost cap panel. If that is not agreed, then it's up to the panel - formed of between six and 12 independent judges - to decide a penalty. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It's incredibly unlikely. While a deduction of championship points is one of the penalties listed above - and Max Verstappen's already contentious advantage of only eight points over Lewis Hamilton last year means any meaningful points penalty would put his title at risk - that punishment was only really on the table if Red Bull had committed a 'material' breach, going over five per cent, as their rivals suspected. For the minor offence, a fine or a public reprimand have been mooted so far, although a limit on testing or a reduction of a future cap could have more significant consequences down the road. Red Bull have staunchly protested their innocence over the last few weeks and that continued after the FIA's verdict. The team said they noted the findings \"with surprise and disappointment\", insisting they have complied. \"Our 2021 submission was below the cost cap limit, so we need to carefully review the FIA's findings as our belief remains that the relevant costs are under the 2021 cost cap amount,\" they added. Red Bull's first move is to ponder an accepted breach agreement, although while that would mean a milder punishment and could not be appealed, it would also require an acceptance of wrongdoing from the team. Their stance so far has hinted they are not willing to do that. \"Despite the conjecture and positioning of others, there is of course a process under the regulations with the FIA which we will respectfully follow while we consider all the options available to us,\" said the team on Monday night. If Red Bull cannot prove their numbers were correct, do not enter an accepted breach agreement, and are handed a punishment by the cost cap panel, they can appeal to the FIA's International Court of Appeals. If that fails, they could even escalate it further than that. No. The formal complaints of the cost cap submissions - which were back in March - could only be raised by other teams between January 1 and April 30 of this year. Crucially, no complaints were made by teams by that April date, so while Mercedes and Ferrari in particular have raised concerns publicly about Red Bull's overspend, they did not do so to the FIA. A team can also not protest another team's certification. As Red Bull's guilt was confirmed on the Monday after the Japanese GP and there has been no race since, no team boss or other employee has spoken publicly about the breach. However, a letter sent by McLaren boss Zak Brown last week to the FIA has been leaked. In the letter, first reported by the BBC, Brown, while not mentioning Red Bull by name, is quoted as writing that the breach \"constitutes cheating\" and says that team has an \"unfair advantage\". He also states that a financial penalty would not be sufficient, insisting \"there clearly needs to be a sporting penalty\" and that a punishment must be handed out sooner rather than later. It has been over 300 days since last season's championship was decided and more than half a year since these numbers were first submitted, so the FIA is likely to want to get this settled as quickly as possible. The speed of a resolution, however, likely depends on how hard Red Bull fight their corner. If there is an accepted breach agreement, it could be quick and there would be no appeals. If not, this may drag on. This is a big moment for the FIA as it looks to lay down the law on the new cost cap. If Red Bull continue to be found guilty but get a mild punishment, rival teams will likely be up in arms and the integrity of the budget cap in future years is at risk. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  If Red Bull fight their case and are proved to be correct, this also raises questions about the cost cap's findings. \"I think it's fundamentally a good system - in its early stages - and a cornerstone of why Formula 1 is so strong at the moment,\" said Sky Sports F1 pundit Martin Brundle. \"Stopping teams spending two and three hundred million has been achieved but now we need to tighten up the last few million to make it fair.\" There have been calls by many in F1 for a change to the five per cent overspend, which as aforementioned could put penalties into the same bracket if there was an overspend by thousands, and by upwards of $7m. Some have suggested this is lenient for teams who do overspend by a significant amount, making them only 'half guilty'. \"What seems absolutely crazy to me is that a minor breach can be up to five per cent overspend on the cost cap,\" added Brundle. \"That is $7m and we know that is a massive upgrade on a car, maybe even a B-spec for some teams. \"That needs tightening up for starters, because what is the point in having $145m and then having this five per cent variant? \"It has got to be made clear that you stick to the cost cap or just under it or otherwise it is going to hurt.\"", "max-verstappen-explains-different-emotions-of-2021-and-2022-titles-hints-at-early-formula-1-retirement": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Max Verstappen has opened up on the \"very different emotions\" of his two Formula 1 title triumphs, admitting his 2022 domination has been more \"enjoyable\" than the fierce battle against Lewis Hamilton. As opposed to 2021 when the championship went down to the last lap of the last race - contentiously won by Verstappen - this year the Dutchman has stormed clear and wrapped up his crown with four rounds to spare. \"Yeah, very different emotions,\" admitted Verstappen, 25, after he won the Japanese GP, his 12th victory from 18. \"You know, last year, all the way until the last race is probably the worst kind of feeling, going into that last race.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Verstappen's current contract expires at the end of 2028, when he will be 31 years old. \"I don't see myself driving until I'm 40 because I want to also do other stuff,\" Verstappen said. \"I'm having a lot of fun with what I'm doing right now and I'm still in F1 for a couple more years... I'm signed until '28. \"After that, it also depends how everything is going but I will probably try to do a few different kinds of racing because it's important also to try different things.\" Verstappen did, however, add: \"I really enjoy being part of this team for a long time and hopefully for a long time to come.\" The drivers' championship may be over, but we have four spectacular races to finish the season - starting with the United States GP from Austin, Texas on October 21-23.

The start of the rain-disrupted Suzuka race was overshadowed by the tractor on track, which was recovering Carlos Sainz's stricken Ferrari. Gasly, well behind the pack behind the Safety Car, passed it at high speed and was immediately and emotionally reminded of French countryman Bianchi, who eight years earlier at the same track in Japan lost control of his car and hit a recovery vehicle. The next year, he died from his injuries. Red Bull driver Sergio Perez called Sunday's shocking scenes \"the lowest point we've seen in the sport for years\" and Brundle, who was not in Japan, voiced his concern when asked about it on Any Driven Monday. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"I was horrified because I had an incident there in Suzuka in 1994 when I'd been crying on the radio for the race to be red flagged because the conditions were horrific,\" said Brundle, the Sky Sports F1 pundit. \"I aquaplaned off in a place where I couldn't see, even my dashboard, I went off and just missed one of the caterpillar diggers but unfortunately hit a marshal and ran back to help him. The bone of his leg was sticking out of his overalls and it was a horrible mess. \"After that experience, I remember saying in '98 [on commentary], 'we can't have vehicles on track when race cars are on track'.

Of course we did have the awful incident again in 2014 when we effectively lost Jules Bianchi. \"You just can't have it.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Gasly slammed the incident as disrespectful to Bianchi and his family and admitted he feared for his life on Sunday. The AlphaTauri driver was later handed a penalty by the FIA for driving too fast in the conditions. But while Gasly accepted the penalty, Brundle says he should never have been put in that position as it should have been an \"instant red flag\". \"It's unquestionably unacceptable,\" added Brundle. \"That should have been an instant red flag in my opinion because of the conditions, because everybody was out on intermediates. \"You can't see where you're going in the cars, you're still going quite quickly at Safety Car speeds and I'm going to assume that Alex Albon's stricken Williams was somewhere in the vicinity as well. \"I've seen other footage, the truck was straight out there, marshals on track, lessons hadn't been learned.

Lewis Hamilton finished fifth behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon in Sunday's rain-shortened race while Russell only managed eighth. A lack of straight-line speed was an issue - and in Mercedes' latest race review, trackside engineering boss Andrew Shovlin admits \"overtaking was very, very hard\" and that \"the right decision would have been a lower downforce setting\" - but so was team strategy. Mercedes double stacked Hamilton and Russell, slowly, three laps into the resumed race, despite other drivers pitting sooner for intermediate tyres and finding pace and ultimately positions in clear air. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Russell dropped down to 14th as a result of that call and said on team radio it was the \"worst decision we've made\". After the race, he said: \"We need to review what went on. I was right behind Lewis and double stacking I was just going to lose all the positions. \"We need to sit down and see what we could have done better. At the time, it was not the right thing to do.\" The world champions, still without a race win in 2022, have conceded their error. \"We've gone through all the timing of that and we have concluded that no, it wasn't the right decision,\" said Shovlin. \"We should have done what George was asking which was to give him the lap in in clean air. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"Now, we had seen that the intermediates were a lot quicker, so on the wets you would have lost time on track.

Chadwick was this week confirmed as the 2022 W Series champion after being 50 points ahead of the nearest challenger when the season was ended early due to expected funding falling through. The British driver is now a three-time title-winner of the W Series and during her incredibly dominant recent season, Chadwick was open about her goal of making the step up to Formula 1 \"within the next five years\" and said she wasn't expecting to remain in the W Series for 2023. Speaking further on Any Driven Monday, Chadwick confirmed she is looking 'positively' at the options now available to her and really enjoyed testing in IndyLights - the feeder series to IndyCar in the United States. \"Nothing is confirmed yet, but I did the test with the Andretti team, and it was awesome,\" Chadwick said. \"I really enjoyed driving the car and I really loved working with the team. \"I think the Indy Lights, IndyCar route - the road to Indy it's called - is really cool for young drivers.

After weeks of speculation, it was finally confirmed on Monday that Red Bull were found guilty of a 'minor' breach of last year's $145m budget cap, meaning they have exceeded the legal amount by less than five per cent. Potential penalties range from financial to sporting and even the docking of points, although with Red Bull fiercely contesting the FIA's verdict - and not thought to be much over the limit - a severe punishment is not expected. Still, Brundle says the rules need to be looked at to discourage breaches in the future, as he weighed in on the F1 controversy on Any Driven Monday. \"What seems absolutely crazy to me is that a minor breach can be up to five per cent overspend on the cost cap,\" said the Sky Sports F1 pundit. \"That is $7m and we know that is a massive upgrade on a car, maybe even a B-spec for some teams. \"So, that needs tightening up for starters, because what is the point in having $145m and then having this five per cent variant?

Will they want to revisit points, will it be manufacturers' points or drivers' points for 2021? \"How hard do the FIA want to be on this?\" The FIA has not yet specified when Red Bull's punishment will be revealed, but the team's staunch defence on Monday night makes an 'accepted breach agreement' - where they would agree on an infringement with the cost cap panel and a punishment - unlikely. When the penalties are revealed may come down to how hard Red Bull want to fight their corner. The penalties listed by the FIA for a minor breach include a deduction of drivers' and constructors' championship points, which if applied could have an impact on the contentious 2021 title battle between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, and a suspension. Other, more realistic, penalties could be a reprimand, fine, a limitation to conduct aerodynamic or other testing, and/or a reduction in that team's future cost cap limit.

The all-female racing series, which features as part of the support package at select Formula 1 Grands Prix throughout the year, was seven races into a planned 10 of its third season, with the most recent round being in Singapore just over a week ago. But with contracted funding from one investor - now no longer involved with the series as a result - failing to arrive as expected in mid-September, it left W Series organisers with no alternative but to scrap the upcoming race in Austin and the season-ending double-header in Mexico City to switch their sights to getting financial backing in place for next year. The curtailment means championship leader Jamie Chadwick retains her title, with W Series regulation specifying a minimum of six races need to be completed in a season before a champion can be declared. \"We've had offers from a number of people, but the problem is getting money in doesn't happen at the shake of a money tree and people have got to go through due diligence,\" W Series CEO Catherine Bond Muir, who remains highly optimistic about the prospects for 2023, said. \"We believed up until this weekend there was a possibility for us to get to Austin and we've just had to call it because there are deadlines on payments of things which need to be done. \"We could have kept it on for a couple of weeks, but we had to make a pragmatic call today.

The intention is for the W Series to continue covering all of the costs of the competitors in 2023 and beyond too, something Bond Muir believes is vital to ensure the best female racers come to the fore. \"They are drivers, in their blood all they want to do is race and they were incredibly upset, but at the same time as being incredibly upset they were understanding,\" Bond Muir said. \"Really, the feeling that came out of it was 'this is rubbish, but it's what we've dealt with for 20 years'. \"They've had promises of money, they've had contractual commitments and they haven't come through, they've had lots of people saying they're going to support them, and it doesn't happen. It was more of a feeling of 'welcome to our world, we understand what you're doing'. \"As far as we're concerned at the moment, we want to keep the DNA of the W Series going and it is still our intention to be providing all of the expenses for the drivers.\" Chadwick's confirmation as champion continues her dominance of the series since its inception in 2019, with the British racer now a three-time title-winner and finishing the year 50 points ahead of nearest challenger Beitske Visser, who won the last round in Singapore.

As reported by Sky Sports News last week, Red Bull have overstepped last season's $145m cap by less than five per cent, although an exact figure has not been revealed by F1's governing body. Red Bull are the only team to have exceeded the cap, with Aston Martin only having been found to have made a 'procedural' error. F1's governing FIA say its \"Cost Cap Administration is currently determining the appropriate course of action to be taken under the financial regulations\", but Sky Sports News understands the punishment is unlikely to be severe. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Red Bull say they have noted the findings with \"surprise and disappointment\". \"Our 2021 submission was below the cost cap limit,\" the team said. \"So we need to carefully review the FIA's findings as our belief remains that the relevant costs are under the 2021 cost cap amount. \"Despite the conjecture and positioning of others, there is of course a process under the regulations with the FIA which we will respectfully follow while we consider all the options available to us.\" A minor breach of the financial regulations could result in a financial penalty and/or minor sporting penalties. The penalties listed by the FIA include a deduction of drivers' and constructors' championship points, which if applied could have an impact on the 2021 title battle between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, and a suspension. Other, more realistic, penalties could be a reprimand, a limitation to conduct aerodynamic or other testing, and/or a reduction in that team's future cost cap limit. The results were finally published on Monday following a delay amid intense speculation about which teams had failed to comply and by how much. If Red Bull had committed a major, or 'material', breach of F1's financial regulations, a points deduction and an extraordinary stripping of Verstappen's title from last year would have been more likely. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The FIA said no \"full formal investigations\" were launched into the breaches due to it being the first year of the cost cap. Aston Martin's breach, a procedural one, relates to the failure to fill in forms correctly. Williams were also found guilty of this and fined $25,000 earlier this year. It was heavily rumoured during the Singapore GP weekend that two teams had fallen foul of F1's budget cap, with the paddock convinced Red Bull and Aston Martin were the teams in question. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  While Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said it was an \"open secret\" and demanded action, Red Bull and Aston Martin vehemently denied the accusations. Christian Horner, Red Bull boss, called the claims \"fictitious\" and remained adamant about his team's innocence at the Japanese GP. \"We feel we've absolutely complied with the cost cap, with the regulations,\" he told Sky Sports F1. \"We're happy with our submission and are waiting to hear what the feedback is.\" Red Bull have yet to comment on being found in breach of the cost cap. Red Bull's main rivals Mercedes and Ferrari have both called for \"severe action\" over any breach that could have had an impact on performance. \"The crucial part is that if you have been over in 2021, then you've been over in 2022 and that means you have an advantage into 2023,\" said Wolff. \"If it's true that they formulated a lightweight chassis this year, they may use it the next year, so it's really a cascade of events that can influential on all of the three championships.

Verstappen became a back-to-back champion in confusing circumstances as - while the completion of only 28 of the 53 laps at Suzuka meant he should not have had enough points for a coronation - he took the required maximum points tally. That is because the rule on reduced races and points - new for this year following a 2021 Belgian GP that saw half points scored despite only a handful of laps behind the Safety Car - has been written in such a way that it produced a result that was not intended. The race being between 50 and 75 per cent long should have meant Verstappen scored 19 points, which would not have given him the title even after Charles Leclerc was demoted from second to third behind Sergio Perez. But article 6.5 of F1's sporting regulations says that reduced points only apply if a race is suspended \"and cannot be resumed\".

But, in the end, Checo's move on Charles nailed Max the championship. So you can see his surprise, the team's surprise. But what a wonderful surprise.\" The FIA has indicated it will review the rule, which is expected to be rewritten. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It is Verstappen's second controversial crowning in as many years - although it must be said this year that the Dutchman was going to take the 2022 title regardless, with four races still remaining this season. Verstappen used the words \"confusing\", \"weird\" and \"quite funny\" when reflecting on how he became champion. \"I had no clue what they were going to decide with the points,\" he said. \"Of course, the main target was to win the race. \"But, yeah, once I crossed the line, I was like, 'OK, that was an amazing race. Good points again, but not world champion yet'. Then I did my interview after the race. And then suddenly, my mechanics started to cheer and I was like: 'What's going on?'.

So, it was like: 'Oh, that's amazing. That's a bit weird'. \"But then eventually we had enough points so then we were world champion again!\" Verstappen added: \"To be honest, I don't mind that it was a little bit confusing, I find it actually quite funny. Because, at the end of the day, it's not going to change the result.\" \"Ambiguity about regulations made Formula 1 look amateur.\" Sky Sports F1's Mark Hughes' statement in his recent the-race column reflected the feelings of much of the paddock on the day where F1 did not put on its finest show for many reasons. Just looking at the points, a shortened race giving full points is not how the new-for-2022 rule following a farcical Belgian GP last year was intended. The FIA even said as much when confirming the rule back in February, stating that \"if the leader has completed 50 per cent but less than 75 per cent of the race distance, points will be awarded as follows\" - 19 points for a winner, 14 for second place, 12 for third and so on. But the phrase \"cannot be resumed\" in the regulations negated its use entirely. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Those three words have been kept in, seemingly unintentionally, from previous iterations of the rule, when it existed because the only examples in history were from races which were started and then could not get going again. Suzuka's race finishing after a near two-hour suspension, but not completing all the laps in the three-hour window, was therefore a first, and the rewritten rule was applied correctly, yet still to the bemusement of teams up and down the pit-lane. Confusion continues even now; as an example, the way the rule is written currently means there could have been just three laps completed on Sunday, and full points would have been awarded. With Verstappen nailed-on to become world champion even if he was denied on Sunday, this is nowhere near the controversy of last year. But just imagine if this was the final race.

After coming through the most intense of battles with Hamilton last year, Verstappen has been in a league of his own in 2022. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  While Red Bull have provided Verstappen with a supremely fast car, capable of adapting to the sport's variety of circuits, the Dutchman has driven near faultlessly. Sunday's race at Suzuka was just the fourth time this season Verstappen has won from pole, with his improved race-craft enabling him to win from further back on nine occasions. While for a second year in a row Verstappen's crowning moment came amid great confusion, unlike in 2021 there was no question as to whether the right driver and team had triumphed.

With rain falling, the race directors opted to go ahead with a standing start, at which Verstappen only just held off Leclerc into the first corner after a poor getaway. There was immediately heavy spray severely reducing visibility, causing several incidents in the opening stages. Sebastian Vettel went off track after making contact with Fernando Alonso, Alex Albon sustained damage that resulted in his retirement, but most notably, Carlos Sainz aquaplaned into a barrier before bouncing back onto the track. The Ferrari was left stricken, and it was a minor miracle that the field managed to avoid him as they followed through before the Safety Car was sent out. With conditions worsening as the rain got heavier, and with Sainz's car remaining in a dangerous position, a red flag followed, bringing the cars back into the pits. However, replays would then emerge showing that both a recovery vehicle and marshals had been allowed on track while cars were still out there. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The incident immediately evoked memories of Japan's 2014 race, when driver Jules Bianchi died after a collision with a recovery vehicle. Pierre Gasly, who was trailing the field following his pit-lane start and had not yet caught up with the train behind the Safety Car, reacted furiously at the presence of the recovery vehicle on the track as he narrowly avoided it. \"What is this tractor on track?\" Gasly said on team radio. \"I passed next to it. This is unacceptable. Remember what happened. Can't believe this!

Verstappen, needing to outscore Charles Leclerc by eight points and Sergio Perez by six at Suzuka, dominated in the wet conditions and a late penalty for Leclerc sealed the title with four races of the 2022 season remaining. That coronation, though, was shrouded in doubt after the race as it was initially believed full points would not be awarded, as only 29 laps were completed of the planned 53-lap race due to heavy rain and a long red flag. With between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of the laps completed, Red Bull and most of the F1 paddock thought Verstappen would only be awarded 19 points for his victory. But for the Japanese GP there was a different interpretation of the rules, which state that the reduced points are only applied if a race is suspended \"and cannot be resumed\". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  With the race finishing in the allotted three-hour window, full points were awarded, and a five-second penalty for Leclerc after the race - for gaining an advantage at the final corner - dropped him from second to third behind Perez and handed Verstappen the title. Verstappen, who did not know he had won the championship when he crossed the line, now joins a pantheon of greats to have claimed back-to-back F1 crowns. \"The first one is a little more emotional, the second one is more beautiful,\" said Verstappen. \"It's been a special year, and you need to remind yourself as these kind of years you don't have very often.\" He added to Sky Sports F1: \"It's a pretty crazy feeling, of course, because I didn't expect it when I crossed the line.

Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton are the only other drivers to have managed the feat in the 2000s. Schumacher and Nigel Mansell are the only drivers in F1 history to have won the title earlier than Verstappen. The Dutchman claimed his first title in 2021 in hugely-controversial circumstances against Hamilton, but his defence has been much more dominant after Red Bull aced 2022's new rules with their car. Despite a rocky start to the season with two retirements in the first three rounds, Verstappen chased down and stormed ahead of Ferrari's Leclerc, and has won 12, two thirds, of the season's 18 races. The record for most race wins in a season is 13. \"We came back from some difficulties in the first couple of races, but he and the team have just raised it to another level,\" Red Bull boss Christian Horner told Sky Sports F1. Technical chief Adrian Newey added: \"Max has been absolutely superb this year. \"In the traffic in Singapore he made a little mistake, but apart from that he's made no mistakes and he's always had the speed.

F1's governing body the FIA, however, penalised Gasly for speeding under red-flag conditions, handing him a 20-second time penalty and two penalty points. After a chaotic and crash-heavy start to the race in torrential rain at Suzuka, a recovery vehicle was sent onto the track to collect Carlos Sainz's Ferrari at Turn 12. Most cars passed the crane at slow speed behind the Safety Car, although Gasly - who started in the pit-lane and was well behind the pack - was going quickly as he encountered it in poor visibility. \"What is this tractor on track?\" Gasly said on team radio. \"I passed next to it. This is unacceptable. Remember what happened. Can't believe this! We don't want to see ever, a crane on the track.\" It comes just eight years after Bianchi crashed into a recovery vehicle in similar conditions at the same track in Suzuka. Bianchi died from the injuries sustained in the accident, which led to F1 changes to improve safety. Bianchi's father Phillippe posted on Instagram during the Japanese GP that there was \"no respect for the life of the driver, no respect for Jules' memory\". Gasly, a French compatriot of Bianchi, added to Sky Sports F1 that he was lucky to be alive. \"We lost Jules already,\" he said. \"We all lost an amazing guy, an amazing driver, for the reasons that we know. Eight years ago, on the same track, in the same conditions, with a crane. \"How? How today can we see a crane, not only in the gravel, on a race track, while we are still on the track? I don't understand that. \"Obviously I got scared.

I passed two metres from that crane, and if I was two metres to the left I would have been dead.\" The FIA has since confirmed they are conducting a full investigation into the incident. There were double-waved yellows and shortly after a red flag when Gasly passed the vehicle. The FIA said Gasly was at fault for driving too fast in the conditions, and the Frenchman was hit with penalties after the race. He finished 17th and the penalties demoted him to 18th, with two penalty points taking his 12-month tally to nine out of a permitted 12. \"After passing the scene of the incident, Car 10 continued under the red flag situation, at speeds which exceeded 200 km/h on multiple occasions, and which reached 251 km/h at one point,\" read the stewards' verdict. \"The driver conceded that he now understood that there could have been marshals or obstacles on the track and admitted that he was too fast.

This is not fair. I was doing everything correctly. \"That crane should have not been there. They're probably going to say I was wrong, it was all my mistake, I don't know. All I care about is my colleagues, all of us, in the future we don't face this kind of situation because if I had aquaplaned I would not be standing here and there will be another one after Jules. \"I don't think its respectful for him and all his family.\" Gasly was not the only driver or team boss to slam the recovery vehicle on track. \"That's the lowest point we've seen in the sport for years,\" said Red Bull driver Sergio Perez. \"What happened today just makes me so angry.

We risk our lives, especially in conditions like this. We wanna race. But this… Unacceptable.\" Grand Prix Drivers' Association chairman Alex Wurz added: \"I think we need to discuss a tractor on track..... we can keep it short: this must NOT happen guys.\" \"We lost Jules Bianchi here eight years ago, and that should never ever happen,\" said Red Bull boss Christian Horner. \"There needs to be a full investigation into why there was a recovery vehicle on the circuit. Checo reported it to us and of course in those horrendous conditions when visibility is zero, it's extremely dangerous. \"The Virtual Safety Car was brought in for a reason following that awful accident all those years ago. There needs to be a full, full investigation into why that vehicle was on track because it obviously shouldn't have been there.\" Sainz, whose crash brought out the vehicle, continued: \"Even behind Safety Car, we are going 100,150kph and still at those speeds we see nothing. So if one driver decides to get a bit out of the racing line, has a small aquaplaning, hits a button on the steering wheel and gets a bit out of line and hits a tractor, it's over, no? \"I still don't know why we keep in these conditions risking having a tractor on track because it's worthless anyways. You are going to red flag it anyway, so why risk it?\" Jenson Button: \"I completely agree with Pierre and all the drivers, there should never be a crane on the circuit in those conditions. The other thing is, even if the crane wasn't there, he was going too fast. \"There are double-waved yellows, and you're supposed to be able to stop if you need to. To be fair to Pierre, I don't think any driver respects it that much, but he was going past it at a high speed. Two very different points. \"I totally agree with him there should never be anything on the track that should harm you. But the marshal jumping out the way, it's because he was going very fast past the incident.\" Karun Chandhok: \"We are not laying 100 per cent of the blame on Gasly. My view on it is that they would have seen Gasly still on track and the recovery vehicle is within the white line.

Verstappen's escape means he stays on pole, which he claimed by just 0.010s ahead of Leclerc, and he can seal his second crown by winning and setting a fastest lap in Sunday's race, live on Sky Sports F1 at 6am.

Before the lap that would eventually give him pole, the Dutchman was driving slowly along the fastest section of track, warming up his tyres. Norris, though, took a different out-lap strategy and went to overtake Verstappen on the straight, before the Red Bull swerved left as he tried to accelerate on his cold tyres. Norris had to take swift avoiding action onto the grass. Verstappen raised his hand to apologise to Norris on the in-lap, but the stewards quickly stated he was under investigation, and at risk of a penalty. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The F1 rules state that \"at no time may a car be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person\". However, after meeting with Verstappen and Norris, the stewards only issued a reprimand as \"all previous breaches of this nature\" have previously resulted in that punishment. \"The driver of car 1 was aware of car 55 in front and car 4 approaching from behind and decided to accelerate at precisely the same time as car 4 decided to overtake car 1,\" noted the verdict. \"Unfortunately, due to lack of tyre temperature on car 1, the driver temporarily lost control of the car causing it to 'snap' anti-clockwise. \"The driver of car 4 stated that this was simply an unfortunate incident however it is the driver's responsibility to at all times maintain control of their car.\" Before seemingly accepting that Verstappen's move was unintentional, Norris had accused his good friend of impeding him. \"I mean it was quite clear he tried to [block me],\" Norris told Sky Sports F1. \"There's no rule on what you can do, but doing what he did is something that you cannot do. \"People always overtake before the last corner, as much as everyone agrees to it [gentleman's agreement], everyone always does it, so it doesn't matter, he probably would have done the same if he was in my situation, but I wouldn't have swerved at him if I was in his situation.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Verstappen, however, argued that Norris should have been more \"respectful\". \"We were on our out-lap and we were all lining up to try to create a gap to everyone, and somehow he still wanted to get me into the chicane,\" said Verstappen. \"But I was at the point of acceleration, I was on very cold tyres so I had a little moment and that's why he had to drive around me. \"But if you're just a bit more respectful, then everyone is anyway already lining up. I don't think anyone is trying to pass into that last chicane, so basically by trying to pass me you create that kind of problem.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Christian Horner also cited a \"gentleman's agreement\" that drivers hold position at the end of their out-laps. Verstappen added to Sky Sports F1: \"Lando is a very good friend of mine so I would never deliberately push him off the track... maybe he thinks I did. \"I saw he was coming quite quick and I wanted to stay ahead of him, and as soon as I accelerated I lost the rear by having cold tyres. I had a big moment and tried to correct the car, and that's why he had to go through the grass. \"Maybe he saw it as I was trying to turn in on him but I lost the car and I couldn't have done anything else.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Red Bull and Ferrari were in a league of their own on Saturday - while Mercedes were locked in a battle behind with McLaren and Alpine. Lacking straight-line speed in a car they surely cannot wait to see the back of, Hamilton and Russell had to put their all into just making it into Q3 and in the end could only manage sixth and eighth respectively. They were beaten by Ocon and sandwiched by the other impressive Alpine of Fernando Alonso.

With both of Friday's practice sessions having taken place in the wet, Saturday's early session gave the first indicator as to how the running order may look in dry conditions, which are expected to remain for qualifying. It was Verstappen, who can seal his second title by winning the race and taking the fastest lap on Sunday, who showed strong pace at the Suzuka circuit as he led the way with a 1:30.671. In testing windy conditions, which could throw up further challenges in qualifying, Verstappen initially appeared in a league of his own, before Ferrari duo Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc closed the margin to finish either side of three tenths back from the Dutchman in second and third, respectively. Fernando Alonso took an impressive fourth for Alpine, while Verstappen's Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez was fifth. Mercedes were unable to maintain the strong performance they had shown in the wet when claiming a one-two in Practice Two, with George Russell edging out Lewis Hamilton for sixth as both trailed Verstappen by almost a second. The Silver Arrows' best hope of competing for a podium in Sunday's race would appear to be if the forecast of possible showers comes to fruition. \"Red Bull have just built a car that's very versatile this year, they can go out on tracks like this, Silverstone, Suzuka, Spa and get the job done,\" Sky Sports F1's Paul di Resta said after the session.

However, with F1 returning to Japan for the first time since 2019 after the previous two editions of the race were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, there is no shortage of excitement amongst the hugely passionate fans, many of whom are hoping to see Verstappen's Honda-powered Red Bull seal the title at the Japanese engine manufacturer's home race.", "pierre-gasly-to-join-alpine-for-2023-f1-season-as-nyck-de-vries-confirmed-as-alphatauri-replacement": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Alpine have confirmed the signing of Pierre Gasly for the 2023 Formula 1 season, while AlphaTauri have announced Nyck de Vries as his replacement.  Having been snubbed by current driver Fernando Alonso (leaving for Aston Martin) and reserve Oscar Piastri (McLaren) for a seat next year, Gasly was always Alpine's number one target - as reported by Sky Sports F1 in August - and they have now landed their man. Gasly, the always highly-rated but often overlooked driver, who has 103 races and one incredible win under his belt, will form an all-French line-up with Esteban Ocon. \"It was a clear call and definitely very attractive,\" Gasly, 26, told Sky Sports F1. \"It felt the right time for me to take my own start and take my career on my own and start this incredible story with Alpine.\" \"He brings a wealth of experience, and speed,\" stated Alpine boss Otmar Szafnauer. \"And those are the two things we were looking for.\" Gasly is leaving the Red Bull family for the first time in his F1 career, with Alpine agreeing a deal with the team to release the star of their sister outfit, AlphaTauri, who in June had extended the Frenchman's contract to cover the 2023 season. AlphaTauri very briefly replaced Alpine in having one of the three seats available on the 2023 grid, but almost immediately announced that they had signed Mercedes reserve and impressive recent Williams stand-in, Nyck de Vries. De Vries' hopes of securing a 2023 drive had appeared in the balance until he produced a hugely impressive race debut when stepping in at short notice for the unwell Alex Albon in Monza in September, catapulting himself to the top of multiple teams' wish-lists. The 27-year-old comes into the sport with plenty of pedigree having been a Formula 2 champion in 2019, and more recently having triumphed on the Formula E circuit, while his he also equipped himself well during free practice outings for Mercedes, Aston Martin and Williams earlier this season. \"I'm extremely excited to be joining Scuderia AlphaTauri for 2023\" De Vries said. \"After Formula 2, I took a slightly different path with motorsport, but F1 has always been my dream and I'm grateful to be able to fulfil it. \"I've had a lot of chances to experience the 2022 car this year and I think that has put me in a great position for the upcoming season, I hope this has helped to prepare me for what is to come.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost paid tribute to Gasly and the Frenchman's \"very successful time\" with the team, before welcoming a \"new chapter\" with De Vries \"Now, we are pleased to start a new chapter with Nyck, who's very much welcome at Scuderia AlphaTauri,\" Tost said. \"He is a very high skilled driver, as he won in all the categories he competed in, with many races and championships under his belt. His last big success was winning the Formula E World Championship, and this is clear evidence that he is a very competitive driver, who deserves a seat in F1.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Alpine's pursuit of Gasly took place despite it being known that his relationship with the team's other driver, Ocon, has not always been the smoothest. However, Ocon posted on social media to welcome his new team-mate, while Alpine boss Szafnauer insisted he was \"confident\" the team will be able to manage the situation. \"I'm confident. We spoke to both of them, and they both said it's their profession and they'll be professional, they'll work together to drive the team forward, and that's what it's about,\" Szafnauer said. \"If there's a little friction as well that could be a good thing, but I think working closely together as they said they will do, perhaps that friendship can be rekindled.\" Gasly, meanwhile, expressed his gratitude to Red Bull for agreeing to release him from his deal for next season. \"What's easy in Formula 1? Nothing is easy!\" Gasly said. \"I must admit I'm very thankful to everyone involved because everybody tried their absolute best to make it happen. \"On Red Bull's side, Christian [Horner, team boss] and Helmut [Marko, team advisor] understood how important, how big this opportunity was to me and my desire to go there and start this new adventure with Alpine.\" Gasly added: \"It's a big change in my career. I'm closing a nine-year chapter with Red Bull, having had a lot of success in younger categories as well as my five years in Formula 1, my first win, podiums. \"I'm starting a new chapter with Alpine. It's a fresh start.\" Gasly said he was convinced by Alpine's form in recent years and their pace this season, with the team currently just behind McLaren in the battle for fourth. It is his biggest career step up since his brief and unsuccessful stint alongside Max Verstappen at Red Bull in 2019. \"I had another year in my contract and it was kind of sealed for next year, then everything happened and this opportunity came up,\" Gasly said. \"I thought about it and I must admit straight away I knew this was the right move.\" Alpine's signing of Gasly brings an end to a remarkable off-track saga in Formula 1 - one the team never foresaw. First, two-time world champion Alonso shocked Alpine by agreeing a deal with Aston Martin, and then came the even bigger surprise when Piastri rejected his team's announcement and set his sights on McLaren. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Alpine fought hard to keep the Australian but lost out in a Contract Recognition Board hearing, leaving them without a driver for 2023. While publicly embarrassed in that chase, the team had the bonus of having the most competitive seat available on the market and plenty of potential suitors. But although Daniel Ricciardo's name was immediately linked and Alpine tested three younger drivers in August, Gasly was always their preferred choice. \"It started probably early August and here we are in October, so it's had its ups and downs and its ebbs and flows,\" said Szafnauer. \"But we got there. We worked towards making him available and it will be great next year.\" Red Bull agreed to release Gasly, but only if they had a suitable replacement lined up at AlphaTauri. The team initially targeted IndyCar standout Colton Herta - whose F1 dream has been dented by a lack of superlicense points - before turning their attention to De Vries.

After not being held in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Japanese Grand Prix returns this weekend and could see Max Verstappen crowned as world champion. Sunday's race is at 6am, with build-up from 4.30am. After finishing seventh in Singapore, Verstappen needs to outscore Ferrari's Charles Leclerc by eight points and Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez by six points to make it back-to-back drivers' titles. Should the 25-year-old do so, it would give Red Bull's Japanese power unit technical partner Honda a reason to celebrate in their home race too. Since its inception as a Formula 1 race in 1976, the Japanese Grand Prix has seen the Drivers' Championship decided on 12 occasions - starting with James Hunt's title triumph over Niki Lauda in the rain at Fuji in the second edition the following year. The event's return to the calendar at Suzuka in 1987 after a nine-year absence saw Nelson Piquet secure his third world title, with compatriot Ayrton Senna sealing the first of his three championships with victory one year later. The Japanese Grand Prix of 1989 and 1990 have gone down as two of the most infamous in Formula 1's history with collisions between Senna and bitter rival Alain Prost proving decisive. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Prost was crowned champion after the Brazilian's disqualification in the former, with a first-corner clash in the latter which took both drivers out seeing Senna claim title glory. He would follow that up by sealing the last of his championships in the 1991 race at Suzuka. Damon Hill's emotional victory in 1996 saw him follow in his late father Graham's footsteps of being crowned world champion, while both of Mika Hakkinen's titles (1998 and 1999) were secured at Suzuka too. Michael Schumacher (2001 and 2003) won two of his world titles in Japan, although if Verstappen was to triumph he would be the first driver to seal the title at Suzuka since former Red Bull racer Sebastian Vettel in 2011.

Max Verstappen, who can clinch a second world championship this weekend by winning the race with a fastest lap, was a further six tenths back as he edged out Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez for third. Charles Leclerc finished 11th after enduring a challenging session, which began with the Ferrari narrowly escaping a collision with the barrier as he went off track at Turn 11.

As a competitive market continues to take shape deep into the 2022 season, we've rounded up the runners and riders for each of the seats as we edge closer to a full confirmed grid... The favourite: Pierre Gasly(Extreme) outsiders: Jack Doohan, Antonio Giovinazzi, Mick Schumacher, Daniel Ricciardo, Nyck de Vries After being shocked by Fernando Alonso and snubbed by Oscar Piastri, Alpine said they had a shortlist of \"14 drivers\" for what is the best available seat in 2023. But in truth, their eyes have always been fixed on Pierre Gasly. Gasly makes sense for a lot of reasons. He's French, still young (26) but with five seasons, and a race win, under his belt, and would likely hit the ground running to form a very handy line-up with Esteban Ocon. The one problem is, he is contracted to Red Bull and is a key part of their sister team AlphaTauri. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Red Bull are open to parting ways with Gasly - for a fee - but would want an adequate replacement first (which we will come on to in the next section). The word from the paddock in Singapore was that a deal is all but confirmed, and is expected to be announced sooner rather than later. In the event of a last-minute hitch, Alpine do have some alternatives. Perhaps nervous of another driver market sucker punch by missing out on Gasly, they tested three drivers in a 2021 Alpine car last week at the Hungaroring, Nyck de Vries, Jack Doohan and Antonio Giovinazzi. De Vries is one of the hot commodities of this year's driver market, while Giovinazzi would more likely stay within the Ferrari family to get back into F1, but it would not be a surprise if Doohan is very high up on Alpine's list. Alpine have been keen to promote from their driver academy for some time (with Piastri always the favourite), but Australian driver Doohan is currently fourth in his first full season in Formula 2 and is highly rated internally. Daniel Ricciardo and Mick Schumacher are even more extreme outsiders for this seat. Ricciardo has not been really mentioned by Alpine since early August, with Renault bosses thought to be uneasy about bringing back the 33-year-old, while Schumacher probably has not done enough at Haas to earn a promotion up the grid. The favourite: Nyck de Vries AlphaTauri would ideally want Gasly, who only signed a new contract for 2023 in June, to stay. But with Gasly unlikely to get a step up back to Red Bull anytime soon - he did not impress the team in his brief spell in 2019 and Sergio Perez is locked in for multiple years - the senior team may try and get compensation for the Frenchman while they can. This has always been dependent on finding a replacement, and with no junior drivers making their case to be F1's next star to come through the Red Bull programme, they have been looking further afield. IndyCar star Colton Herta was their number one target, although - despite winning seven races in the top US single-seater championship - he does not have enough superlicense points. That collapse appeared to point towards Gasly staying put, but a new front-runner has emerged... that man De Vries. De Vries, while never having raced in F1, would fit Red Bull and AlphaTauri's desire for a proven driver to come in for Gasly, and the Dutchman has admitted he has held talks with the team's transfer advisor Helmut Marko. He seems to be their only fallback right now; if he does not sign, it is likely Gasly stays. The favourites: Mick Schumacher, Nico Hulkenberg,Outsiders:, Antonio Giovinazzi, Robert Schwartzman, Daniel Ricciardo Haas are the wildcard in this driver market and it has been hard to predict which direction they are heading in. What does seem certain is that the US team are seriously considering moving on from Schumacher for 2023, with the German driver having been out-performed by Kevin Magnussen this season. Schumacher is also set to leave the Ferrari driver programme, and his links to the Scuderia were one of the reasons he joined Haas in the first place. Giovinazzi, the Ferrari reserve and man who was in truth unlucky to lose his Alfa Romeo seat this year, has been heavily linked with the team, as has another former F1 driver Nico Hulkenberg, who has served as a reserve with Aston Martin this season. More of a like-for-like replacement for Schumacher would be fellow Ferrari driver programme product Robert Schwartzman, who has served as a reserve driver for the Italian team this season. Schwartzman, who holds dual Israeli and Russian nationality, is said to have impressed Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto and, at the age of 23, would provide another forward-looking option for Haas. Ricciardo, who has also been linked with the seat, would be the headline signing Haas have been waiting for since their F1 debut six years ago, and would be a big hit Stateside. However, it remains to be seen whether they would have the budget or pedigree to attract Ricciardo, who has made it clear he is open to a test-driver role with a stronger outfit in 2023 if the right drive does not present itself. During the Singapore GP, chatter suggested it is Hulkenberg who has emerged as the most likely driver to replace Schumacher, with the pair now in a shoot-out for the position The favourite: Logan SargeantOutsiders: Nyck de Vries, Mick Schumacher, Antonio Giovinazzi Nicholas Latifi's impending exit leaves an opening at Williams, whose movements could depend on how the dominoes fall in the driver market. Given his pedigree, and more importantly, how well he performed in Alex Albon's absence in Italy, De Vries would surely be Williams' preferred choice, but they appear set to miss out on him to AlphaTauri. Other than De Vries, Logan Sargeant is the name that has cropped up most in links with Williams. American driver Sargeant is a Williams junior and is third in the F2 standings. He is well thought of at Williams, who have American owners, and will make his practice debut for the team at the United States GP next month. Schumacher could be a driver of interest should he leave Haas - he has done enough in his two years in F1 to prove he belongs - while Giovinazzi fits that bill of a solid driver alongside Albon, too. The reality is the 2023 grid is still incredibly difficult to predict, even at this late stage of the season.

Having arrived in Singapore on the weekend of his 25th birthday with an active streak of five successive victories and faint, yet not completely unrealistic, hopes of sealing the title, all had appeared rosy for Verstappen. However, a fuel-shortage blunder from Red Bull in qualifying saw him go from a likely pole position start to eighth on the grid, before errors of his own ended any hopes of a podium as he finished seventh in the race. \"It's not where we want to be,\" Verstappen told Sky Sports F1, after his team-mate Sergio Perez claimed the victory. \"Yesterday, you put yourself in a spot like that and it can either work brilliantly and you can drive back to the front or it's very frustrating like we had.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Verstappen made a terrible start, dropping four places as he almost stalled on the grid, leaving him 12th at the end of the first lap. However, he quickly recovered, climbing to seventh before being held up by Fernando Alonso, whose retirement with an engine failure, put the Dutchman up to sixth. He would gain another place during the round of pit stops that followed, but then at the restart after the last of the race's five safety car (three virtual) interventions, attempted an unwise overtake on Lando Norris. A huge lock-up saw him flat-spot his tyres as well as running into the escape road, after which he had to pit once more.

That proved to be a terminal blow to Hamilton's hopes, as the Spaniard's lack of pace meant Hamilton was never given the clear air to show if he had the speed to rival the front two. \"(It was) a difficult start and then getting stuck behind Carlos. I don't know why he was so slow but obviously, I was not quick enough to get past him in these conditions,\" Hamilton said. \"And then just sitting behind him. I think I could have done similar times to the guys ahead, but because I was stuck behind him I couldn't. I think if I was in third, I could have kept with the guys up ahead.\" Having trailed Sainz closely for most of the race, frustration got the better of Hamilton on lap 33, as he locked up attempting to pressure the Spaniard and went straight on into the barrier at Turn 7. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The seven-time world champion was fortunate to sustain manageable damage to his front wing and was even able to keep Verstappen behind him after rejoining the track in fifth. However, with the incident coinciding with the point at which the track was becoming slick-ready, Mercedes opted to pit Hamilton for a new front wing as well as new tyres. Then, with Vettel in front of him and Verstappen behind him in the closing stages, Hamilton once more misfired with an overtake, and was left to finish ninth. \"I think we started off with a pretty decent weekend and were just really, really unfortunate at the end,\" Hamilton said. \"It was difficult to overtake and that lock-up into Turn 7 - when those things happen your heart sinks a little bit.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"It's a massive, massive result for him and I'm super-proud of him today. \"I think it even surpasses his Monaco victory and under massive pressure, he's gone out and delivered.\" Stewards investigated Perez for two infringements behind the Safety Car for failing to remain within 10 car lengths behind. He was given a reprimand for the first incident, and received a five-second penalty for the second, meaning he was still declared as the winner.

I think on the places where I could keep up with him, he was super slow. And the places where I could not keep up with him, he was fast.

Red Bull's Perez had to wait two and a half hours for his victory to be confirmed, as stewards investigated him for leaving too much distance between himself and the safety car on two separate occasions during the race, which also saw three virtual safety car deployments. The FIA ultimately decided to penalise Perez with a five-second penalty, which meant he kept his second win of the season, having finished 7.5 seconds clear of Leclerc. Perez passed pole-sitter Leclerc off the line at the start and withstood heavy pressure from the Monegasque for large portions of the gruelling contest at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, with the race ending at the two-hour time limit as the multiple interruptions ensured the full 61 laps could not be completed. \"It was certainly my best performance,\" Perez said. \"I controlled the race. \"The last three laps were so intense - when I got out of the car, I felt it. I gave everything today.\" Singapore's stunning night race, which was being held for the first time in three years after the coronavirus pandemic saw the previous two editions cancelled, only finished shortly after 11pm local time after a torrential downpour delayed the start by over an hour, with the drivers starting on intermediate tyres before switching to slicks midway through in testing slippery conditions. Verstappen, who needed to win the race from eighth on the grid to have any chance of claiming his second successive title, looked to be coming into contention for a podium place before making an error that flat-spotted his tyres and forced him to pit.

However, after a Red Bull mishap in qualifying saw Verstappen left to start down in eighth, the team's hopes of victory on a track where overtaking is notoriously difficult were left with Perez, who had surprised many by putting himself on the front row. After a strong start to the season, including a victory at Monaco, Perez was being touted as a title rival for Verstappen, but his form has fallen away in the second half of the campaign, with just one podium coming during his team-mate's recent run of five wins. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  As a result, even after Perez's strong qualifying performance, few were talking about him as a likely race winner as buzz built for the sold-out race on Sunday. The 32-year-old made the best possible start as he got the jump on Leclerc at the start to lead into the first corner, and initially opening a gap. However, as the pair pulled away from Sainz, Leclerc began to close, and after a crash between Nicholas Latifi and Zhou Guanyu triggered the first safety car of the race, the Ferrari began to apply pressure. It was revealed after the race that during that first safety car period, Perez was reprimanded by the stewards for not staying within the required 10 car lengths. Three virtual safety cars followed, one triggered by Alex Albon crashing and the other two by the Alpine failures, but the leaders opted not to pit with their worn intermediate tyres remaining the best option with the drying track not yet ready for slicks. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Leclerc's best opportunity to pass was likely to come with the pit stops, and with the track finally dry enough for slicks, the Ferrari came in first, but immediately damaged his chances by overshooting his pit markings to cause a longer stop. That meant when Perez pitted a lap later he came out comfortably ahead, but another safety car, this time triggered by Yuki Tsunoda crashing, bunched up the field once more. It was at this point that Perez was once more guilty of the same infringement going through Turn 9 and 10, with the race director this time issuing a direct warning to Red Bull to be passed onto the driver. Despite the warning, Perez then did the same thing in Turn 13 and 14, which was the offence for which he was given the five-second penalty. The issue was put on the back-burner as the stewards announced it would be reviewed after the race, and on the slicks, Leclerc appeared to have the pace to get past Perez, applying huge pressure as DRS was enabled for the first time with just over 30 minutes of the race remaining. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  However, a wobble from the Ferrari allowed Perez out of DRS range, and he never relinquished his advantage, before even showing additional pace to crucially extend his lead in the closing stages in anticipation of a potential penalty. Before his victory was confirmed, Perez said: \"I'm pretty confident there's nothing (wrong) with it because there was a bit of miscommunication with (safety car driver) Bernd Maylander. \"I think, on the places where I could keep up with him, he was super-slow, and the places where I could not keep up with him, he was fast, so it was a bit of miscommunication there. \"But I think these conditions are not normal. So it's fully understandable that the conditions that we were in, we were facing, especially the final sector, were super tricky. \"So I do expect no further action in that as the stewards were pleased with my explanation and they understood it.\" It was a day that began with hope for Hamilton, who was seeking a first victory of Mercedes' disappointing season, and for Verstappen, who retained faint hopes of sealing the title, or at least extending his five-race winning streak. However, losing a place to Sainz at the start proved to be a terminal blow to Hamilton's hopes, as the Spaniard's lack of pace meant Hamilton was never given the clear air to show if he had the speed to rival the front two. Having trailed Sainz closely for most of the race, frustration got the better of Hamilton on lap 33, as he locked up attempting to pressure Sainz and went straight on into the barrier at Turn 7. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The seven-time world champion was fortunate to sustain manageable damage to his front wing and was even able to keep Verstappen behind him after re-joining the track in fifth. However, with the incident coinciding with the point at which the track was becoming slick-ready, Mercedes opted to pit Hamilton for a new front wing as well as new tyres. Verstappen made an even worse start, dropping four places to 12th as he almost stalled getting off the grid, and then made minor contact with the Haas of Kevin Magnussen. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  However, he quickly recovered, climbing to seventh before being held up by Alonso, whose timely retirement, from Verstappen's perspective, put the Dutchman up to sixth. Hamilton's mishap put both Verstappen and Norris ahead of him up a place further, but at the restart from the final safety car, the Red Bull driver would make a mistake similar to his great rival's. Attempting to steal a march on Norris, Verstappen flat-spotted his tyres as he locked up and went down the escape road, and then needed to pit for fresh tyres. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He would fight back once more, eventually closing in on Hamilton, who was stuck behind seventh-placed Vettel in the final stages, as the three world champions formed a train in the closing stages. It was Hamilton who blinked, locking up once more as he went for an overtake on Vettel, allowing Verstappen through, before the Dutchman also got past the Aston Martin on the final lap to end an eventful afternoon. \"It's not where we want to be,\" Verstappen said. \"Yesterday, you put yourself in a spot like that and it can either work brilliantly and you can drive back to the front or you or it's very frustrating like we had. \"It's just incredibly messy.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Hamilton's struggles were part of a hugely disappointing weekend for Mercedes, with George Russell last of the classified finishers having started from the pit lane and then gambled on putting on slick tyres before the track was ready for them. The dismal result saw Ferrari strengthen their grip on second in the constructors' championship, establishing a 66-point lead to halt Mercedes' recent gains. \"I think we started off with a pretty decent weekend and were just really, really unfortunate at the end,\" Hamilton said. \"It was difficult to overtake and that lock-up into Turn 7 - when those things happen your heart sinks a little bit. \"It all went out the window when I locked up, so my apologies to the team, but we live and learn, and I'll recover.\" McLaren's haul of 22 points from Norris and Ricciardo, who largely minded their own business in sensible drives, saw the British team leapfrog Alpine and take a four-point lead in the battle for fourth.

Chadwick jumped two places on the opening lap, but was then held up by Jessica Hawkins, eventually losing patience in the closing stages as she attempted an overtake at Turn 7 that ended with the Jenner Racing car in the wall.

With a drying track ensuring near constant drama throughout qualifying on Formula 1's return to the Marina Bay Street Circuit, Hamilton was always near the top of the timesheet as he appeared to have a realistic shot at pole. With the front-runners having switched from intermediates to slicks for the pole-position shoot-out, Hamilton initially appeared to have more pace than his rivals, but as the track further improved the likes of Leclerc, Verstappen and Fernando Alonso all appeared in with a chance of sealing pole. The Brit ultimately finished behind both Ferrari's Leclerc and Red Bull's Perez, with his time agonisingly within just over half a tenth of both the front row cars. Hamilton said: \"I was so happy.

However, the seven-time world champion explained that infections to his nose caused from taking the stud in and out so regularly meant he was given medical advice to keep it in. Having been provided with Hamilton's medical reports, the stewards after qualifying announced their decision to take no further action against him, but did fine Mercedes €25,000 for inaccurately filling out his self-scrutiny form. Speaking before the announcement was made that he had been cleared, Hamilton said: \"It got infected loads of times and I was trying to find a solution and I went back to the clinic and that is the best way for it to heal. \"For me, it is a health part so that is the way it is going to stay and we are going to have to deal with it.\"", "max-verstappen-angry-at-red-bull-after-qualifying-mistake-makes-title-win-in-singapore-unlikely": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Max Verstappen lashed out at his Red Bull team after being forced to abort his final two qualifying laps in Singapore.

However, the car with the best chance of pole appeared to be Verstappen, after he had been told to abort one attempt at a flying lap in an apparent attempt to enhance his track position. The move appeared to have been successful as he crossed the line later than any of his rivals, and then drove a lap that was looking like it would be good enough to take pole from Leclerc.

It took about 10 minutes of wet running before intermediates became the preferred tyre, with Verstappen and the Ferraris quickly establishing themselves in a league of their own.

Horner, as he had done on Friday, insisted Red Bull were confident in their submission, and hinted at the possibility of legal action as he described comments from other teams as \"defamatory\" and said the team are \"looking at what options\" are available to them. \"We were a little bit taken aback by comments that were coming from two of our rival teams yesterday,\" Horner said. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"The submission between the team and the FIA is one that is confidential. I have no idea what the outcome of our rivals' submissions are, or their accounting treatment or so on, so I would be intrigued to know where their source of information for these fictitious claims have come from.\" The FIA, who are expected to make an official announcement on October 5 on any breaches of the budget cap, said on Friday evening that it had noted \"significant and unsubstantiated speculation and conjecture\" on the topic and that its ongoing assessment would be \"followed without consideration to any external discussion.\" Potential punishment for the teams found to have breached the regulations could range from financial penalties to points deduction, with the categorisation of the infringement as 'minor' or 'material' the crucial factor. Red Bull driver Max Verstappen edged out Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton for the 2021 world championship, and has his first opportunity to clinch an all-but-confirmed 2022 crown in Singapore after dominating the current campaign. Horner added: \"The (comments from other teams) are hugely defamatory, and we take umbrage to them. One can only assume it's uncoincidental that this is at a point where Max has his first strike at the world championship. \"How on earth do they have this information? Where do they have this knowledge? The FIA have even stated that they haven't even completed their process. \"So unless there is a clear withdrawal of those statements, we will be taking it incredibly seriously and looking at what the options available to us are, because it is absolutely unacceptable to be making comments of the type that were made yesterday, that are totally defamatory to the team, the brands and even to Formula 1.\" After Horner had said on Friday that he \"wasn't aware\" of any Red Bull breach of the regulations, Wolff told Sky Sports F1 that Horner's comments were \"funny\", and said the alleged breaches are a \"heavyweight issue\" that will have implications on results from the three world championships from 2021-2023. Wolff also urged FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem to take a \"robust stance\" on the matter and said it was of \"huge importance\" for the regulations to be policed. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Horner, when discussing comments from Ferrari and Mercedes, said: \"So perhaps when these accusations are made, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, and we take umbrage and extremely seriously the remarks that have been made, because is it any coincidence that Max has his first shot at winning a world title, and here we are talking nothing but cost caps rather than the phenomenal performance he has had this year. \"I think it's an underhand tactic that's been employed to detract from perhaps a lack of performance on track this year, and of course when references are made to last year, this year, next year, we're going to take that extremely seriously. \"So this is an issue for the FIA to deal with, but also an issue for Red Bull to consider what our position is with those comments that have been made.\" Speaking to Sky Sports F1 shortly after his explosive press conference, Horner further addressed Wolff's claim on Friday that Red Bull had been being investigated for \"weeks and months\". \"Our submission, we believe, is fully compliant with the regulations. It has to be signed off by our auditors way back in March, which was done,\" Horner said. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"But, of course, it is the first year of these budget cap regulations and there is a process with the FIA that I hear, for example, we have been under investigation for six months. \"It is complete rubbish, we heard from the FIA 10 days ago asking for some clarifications, as you would do in a standard audit. Now, that I don't think is a six-month investigation and most of the time we have had visits they have been en route from Brackley. \"It is frustrating and somewhat disappointing to have these very serious allegations made against you, against the team, the people, and when I hear that Mercedes have taken the pain of making 40 redundancies, that is less than 50 per cent of the redundancies and pain we have been through at Red Bull Racing. \"It is fictitious and we are extremely disappointed.

It must be policed, it must be policed heavily. \"I can imagine there's 100,000 little expenses that fall in grey areas that are arguable and as I said they are all gaming the system. \"If someone has gamed the system too much then they will have to take a heavy penalty for it. \"It cannot impact on last season, it would be nonsense to try to unravel all of that again now.\"", "w-series-qualifying-marta-garcia-starts-on-pole-in-singapore-after-rain-curtails-session": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Marta Garcia will start on pole in Singapore on Sunday after treacherous conditions reduced qualifying to just 13 minutes.

The seven-time Formula 1 world champion, who was knighted in 2021, has been listed as a Black History Month hero for his sporting achievements, along with his attempts to promote racial equality. Hamilton has spoken out for many causes during his remarkable career, with his efforts including supporting LGBTQ+ rights by wearing a flag on his helmet, as well as encouraging other drivers to take a knee ahead of races. The 37-year-old sat down with fellow racing driver - and Sky Sports F1 pundit - Naomi Schiff ahead of the start of Black History Month on Saturday. Told about his status as a Black History Month hero, Hamilton said: \"That's the first time I've heard that, and the realisation that you can be a part of it, but I think everyone's a part of it. \"Naturally there are these months to celebrate all those different things through the year, that's why with my helmet for example, the LGBTQ+ flag that I have on it, I've just been running it all year, because there's no reason it should just be one month.

When I was at school, we never ever celebrated it and we never any did any history work on it. \"It was never acknowledged at school, which was really frustrating for me, but knowing my family knew about it and being educated at home about certain individuals, the struggle, the empowerment, the movement, some of the amazing accomplishments that have happened through history, that gave me a lot of hope that firstly there's a place for someone that looks like us, and it was incredibly informative. \"That's where I learnt about Nelson Mandela, who's I would say my biggest inspiration.\" Hamilton in 2021 launched a charitable foundation, Mission 44, to address the disproportionately high rate of school exclusions amongst Black students in the UK.

Lewis Hamilton, having topped the opening session of the weekend earlier in the day, continued to show good pace but was only fifth after traffic interrupted his first attempt at a flying lap on soft tyres. With F1 returning to the Marina Bay Street Circuit for the first time since 2019 after the coronavirus pandemic saw the last two editions cancelled, the track produced its usual spectacular views along with several doses of drama.

A far from ideal start to the weekend for Red Bull was exacerbated by Sergio Perez managing just 11 laps, as he missed the first half of the session with a drive train issue. There was further cause for concern for Red Bull off the track, as team principal Christian Horner denied the team breached the sport's budget cap for last season, with speculation intensifying that they are one of two teams likely to face punishment from the FIA for failing to comply with regulations. The session represented an improvement for Ferrari after neither driver had been able to keep pace with Hamilton and Verstappen earlier in the day, but there was a sense the Mercedes and Red Bull had left some time on the table. Both Hamilton and Russell were unable to complete their first attempts at flying laps on their new soft tyres, with their best times coming after a series of cool-down laps.

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff later described Horner's comments as \"funny\", and said the alleged breaches are a \"heavyweight issue\" that will have implications on results from the three world championships from 2021-2023. The sport introduced a budget cap last season, and reports claim Red Bull are one of two teams who the FIA will announce went over the $145m (£114m) spending limit, with an official announcement expected on October 5.

The rules provide a range of sanctions that can be applied based on the amount by which teams have exceeded the cap. These include fines for minor offences, while material offences could result in a deduction of points from the drivers' and teams' standings, suspension and exclusion from the championship. The FIA released a statement before Horner spoke to Sky Sports F1 on Friday, insisting any breaches would be \"dealt with\" according to the regulations.

Speaking ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, Verstappen said, perhaps in jest, that he had made a deal with his team that if he won the previous race in Monza (which he did) with their heavier version of the chassis, he would continue to use it at this race. Wolff referenced the rumoured development as he continued his criticism, citing the knock-on effects over-spending in 2021 may have had.

So if we are talking now about something big, he will show the same integrity and leadership that he has done before.\" Later, in an interview with PA, Wolff, who spoke directly to Ben Sulayem on Friday night, added: \"I don't know by how much Red Bull have overshot, and where, and what that means as a consequence for last year's championship, this year's championship and next year's championship. \"The catalogue of potential penalties is huge. And the independent judges will come to their conclusions. \"We have had a massive restructuring process in the organisation to save $50m, and it has been overwhelming, distracting and a development deterrent.

They were keeping an eye on me and they told me they had to switch it off.\" Albon was ruled out of the race in Italy with appendicitis and was transferred to nearby San Gerardo Hospital for treatment. He underwent surgery on Saturday, but then ended up in intensive care and required assistance with breathing. He was removed from mechanical ventilation the following day before being given the green light to leave hospital and travel back to his home in Monaco 48 hours later. \"Luckily I was quite drugged up so I don't remember much of it,\" he added. \"I just remember obviously going into surgery. It's a relatively simple procedure, it only takes a couple of hours to be operated on. But obviously you don't understand time when you're sedated. \"When I did wake up, I thought that was the procedure finished, and they said: 'No, you've actually gone through a little bit more than that'. \"It wasn't such a big thing for me, it was more my family who came to the race, and obviously they were in shock.\" Albon will take part in practice with a view to competing in Sunday's 61-lap Grand Prix - despite the humidity of Singapore creating one of the hardest physical challenges of the season. Albon continued: \"It's quite a tricky one because you're basically waiting for your lungs to recover. And at the same time your body can't move as well as it normally can. \"You can't just jump back into normal training, you have to slowly build it up. We really started to push it last Monday. I treated training and recovery like a 9-to-5 job. \"Day by day it was getting better.

After McLaren announced in August the early termination of Ricciardo's contract at the end of the season, the Australian has been linked with vacant seats at Alpine, Williams and Haas, along with reserve roles for front-runners Red Bull and Mercedes. Ricciardo has had a three-week break since the Italian GP to consider his future, and speaking ahead of this weekend's Singapore GP, he admitted he is wary of taking a drive with a team at the back of field. \"Let's say my headspace is in the same space,\" Ricciardo said on Thursday. \"I'm still keen to be part of F1 and of course, 'Plan A' would be to be on the grid. \"So nothing's changed but I don't want to just jump at the first kind of seat available. I know the landscape probably changes as well at the end of next year, with contracts and whatever, so I don't want to say remaining patient, but remaining open.\" Asked specifically about the likelihood of taking a reserve role over a drive, he added: \"It's certainly something that's realistic, yeah. \"That's the two realistic options. It's not to be anywhere else. \"I love other disciplines of motorsport but I don't see myself there. I feel as well if I jump into something like that, and then it closes the door on F1.

There were boos from the grandstands and criticism from many - including the Red Bull and Ferrari bosses - but Wolff praised the handling of the closing stages, and aimed a not-so-sly dig at ex-race director Michael Masi. \"I'm really satisfied to see that there is a race director and colleagues that apply the regulations against the pressure of the media and the fans to just be in breach of the regulations,\" said the Mercedes team principal. \"So at least Abu Dhabi in that sense gave the FIA more robust confidence to apply the regulations.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wolff's comments followed Hamilton, the wronged party last year in Abu Dhabi, saying the Monza finale brought \"memories back\" and that there is \"only one time in the history of the sport where they haven't done the rules like that today and that's the one where it changed the result\". Wolff, like his star driver, was adamant everything had been done by the book on Sunday, as cars were not back in position quickly enough for a green light after a delay in Daniel Ricciardo's McLaren being recovered. \"There's rules and they're written down,\" stated Wolff. \"From my perspective, whether I'm Abu Dhabi traumatised or not, these rules have been followed to the dot. \"There was a car on track, there were marshals, a crane out there, that's why they didn't let anybody overtake and then there wasn't enough time to restart the race once all cars caught up. \"If one is not happy with the regulations and you want to have a big bang show and two laps of racing and mayhem, I'm absolutely up for it.

Wolff has offered his alternatives \"We should think, do we want to have a race finish under green, and then reverse engineer it from there. \"So you can say five or 10 laps from the end we have a Safety Car, let's red flag it - and make sure we are racing at the end. \"If that's in the regulations, then good.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Christian Horner, Red Bull boss: \"We don't want to win a race under a Safety Car.

The Ferraris and their drivers and crew looked resplendent with heavy yellow accents all around. And they looked fast too in taking pole position. With seven cars choosing to, or mostly forced to, take penalties for new power unit components and other misdemeanours, for the second time in three races the grid didn't remotely represent the qualifying order. This is an unacceptable situation because when the fans turn up trackside or switch on their TV sets to watch qualifying, they should reasonably expect that they're watching the race grid being formed. Instead we waited for several hours for the tortuous and complex process of how penalties were applied. We need solutions here because this is a bad look for F1. The initial concept is necessary to stop teams throwing new power units and ancillaries at their cars. Options might include simply giving each driver more power units per season, applying an in-race penalty such as a pitlane drive through to be taken at some point in the race, or giving the teams commensurate financial and championship points pain rather than the drivers having to carry the burden through no fault of their own. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A mixed up grid can make for an interesting race observing drivers making their way through the field, but better still is when the six cars with a realistic chance of winning the race are wheel to wheel in the correct grid places. With 24 races next season and either three or six Sprint races, F1 clearly needs to get the regulatory allocation of power units and sporting regulations sorted out. In the multi-billion dollar world of F1 it looks ridiculous that the teams appear to be short of engines, which of course they're not. I remember when I was driving in the '80s and '90s that we had a new motor pretty much every day, and top teams would have 60 engines either in build, in use, in transit or in refurbishment, which of course is not sustainable or acceptable either.

At least the mystery grid promised some charges through the field and we certainly got that with Carlos Sainz, Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton. Max Verstappen very quickly made his way up to second place from seventh and the grid, Sainz would gain 14 places to finish in fourth place. Lewis Hamilton was less spectacular in his progress but nonetheless finished a fine fifth from 19th on the grid, although he didn't look that impressed as he walked through parc ferme as I waited to interview the top three. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  And then on lap 47 of 53 the McLaren of Daniel Ricciardo, who was having a better run than of late at a track where he of course won last year, broke down at the side of the track. What followed was a catalogue of problems which ruined the end of the race, not that Leclerc was going to catch Verstappen it must be said. Sainz may have had a look at Russell for the final spot on the podium. It was painful to watch. The McLaren was stuck in gear so couldn't be wheeled away after Daniel struggled to find a decent service opening. It's an old school track with poor service road access, and eventually a mobile crane arrived to scoop it up. There has been an initiative discussed whereby, in the final five laps of a race, if there's an issue of this kind then throw the red flag and have a standing start re-start. We saw this in Azerbaijan last year and it does make for great anticipation and a thrilling finale to a race. I must say though that for me a red flag means a very serious incident or something like a cloud burst and a waterlogged track. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The red flag can be used as a tool to neutralise a race along with yellow flags, and one of two safety car options. But when the safety car picked up third place George Russell's Mercedes rather than comfortable race leader Max Verstappen, with a bunch of back markers in between, then it really did fall apart. I must say seeing the cars file past a recovery vehicle and a suspended F1 car reversing down the track, albeit at safety car speeds, it would have been easy to justify a red flag stoppage. Instead, for only the thirteenth time if F1 history a race was ended at low speed behind the safety car. It was not the FIA's finest event. It's such a short race there anyway due to the high average speeds, and the fans would have deserved a thriller at the restart. Max claimed his fifth straight victory with ease. I'm not sure Ferrari could have done anything to stop him but once again it appeared that the team relied heavily on their drivers' views on tyre strategies. An early stop under a virtual safety car deployed to move away Seb Vettel's stricken Aston Martin didn't work for Leclerc and he couldn't respond rapidly enough to Verstappen's relentless speed. He was pretty crestfallen immediately after the race despite his second place.

And the fans' driver of the day. That will surely have sealed a seat for him somewhere next year. F1 is such a fickle business, it's generally assumed by some that the current intake in F2 and the likes are not that strong, and some teams are looking to reintroduce more established drivers. 'There's not much choice out there' I often hear in the paddock but there clearly is if you give some of them a chance. De Vries brought his Williams alive.

The Australian's first IndyCar title came in 2014. \"Oh, man, it sounds so surreal,\" Power said as he crossed the finish line behind outgoing IndyCar champion Alex Palou and Newgarden, who used a white-knuckled drive through the field to make Power sweat until the chequered flag. Power needed only to finish third to win the championship. But Team Penske has proved over the last week that its cars race individually and all three drivers were on their own in this title decider. Newgarden was relentless. \"I'm ultimately just proud of the team,\" said a crestfallen Newgarden. He's talked in the last several days of his personal drive for perfection and the emotional toll it has taken on him. A five-time winner this season, his inconsistency simply put him in too deep of a hole to overcome Power's season of consistency. Newgarden had gone off course in a sloppy qualifying mistake that forced him to start 25th in the 26-driver field. He picked his way through traffic and used three nail-biting passes through Laguna Seca's famed corkscrew to make it tight for Power. One of Newgarden's big moves in the corkscrew was on Power, but Newgarden made it clean and pulled into second behind Palou. The American needed much more than that to win the championship. Power, at 41 years old, has insisted all year he's been playing the long game with an eye on a second title. The Australian won only once, but his average finish was sixth, and he's barely bobbled all year. On Saturday, he won his 68th career pole to break Mario Andretti's mark for most in series history. Now the fastest man in IndyCar is the most consistent, too, and rewarded team owner Roger Penske with a 17th championship. Palou, eliminated from the championship fight last week and locked into a legal battle between Chip Ganassi Racing and McLaren over his 2023 rights, won his first race of the year.

Palou had the field covered and dominated in the win. The four Ganassi cars tested at Laguna Seca but contenders Marcus Ericsson and Scott Dixon were never in Sunday's fight.

Palou in July definitively said he would be a McLaren driver next year. After the win, he sounded less sure. Palou's dominance put the focus on Newgarden, who started the day 21 points behind team-mate Power in the championship standings.

The 2022 Italian GP was similar to the 2021 Abu Dhabi GP in that there was a Safety Car called with few laps remaining. At Monza, however, the race finished behind the Safety Car - with Max Verstappen beating Charles Leclerc - while in Abu Dhabi, the race was incorrectly restarted with one lap remaining. Verstappen would overtake Hamilton, on older tyres, on that final lap, claiming a remarkable world championship.

It also didn't initially release Russell and the 11 cars between him and the leader. Mercedes told Russell to overtake the Safety Car, although the British driver refrained, with no green light showing to give him confidence to do so. Another hindrance was the fact marshals were unable to move Riccardo's car, and a cherry picker only started to recover it with three laps remaining.

Ferrari, seeking a win at its home race, pitted Leclerc after 11 laps under a Virtual Safety Car as the Italian team sought to find any sort of advantage over Verstappen, but the move was in vain as the medium tyres fitted to the Monegasque's car failed to provide the durability or speed to mount a challenge. With Leclerc forced to make a second stop, Verstappen held a near 20-second lead in the closing stages, before a technical failure for Daniel Ricciardo saw the McLaren stop out on track with five laps remaining, and the race end behind a Safety Car.

By lap five he had passed Russell for second, and then began to apply pressure to Leclerc, whose soft tyres were wearing at an alarming rate. When a VSC was triggered by Vettel stopping on lap 11, Ferrari brought Leclerc in, while Verstappen stayed out.

The seven-time world champion continued to advance and passed Fernando Alonso, who later retired with a suspected water pressure issue, for sixth, before pitting and emerging in 12th, but with fresh soft tyres to take him to the end.

F1, taking place this weekend at Monza, held a minute's silence moments before Friday's first session began, which was impeccably observed by drivers and teams in the pit lane and was followed by a short applause. There have also been tributes to The Queen on many of the cars, and touching words from the sport's leading figures. Sainz's time of 1:21.664 saw him outpace world championship leader Max Verstappen by 0.143s, although both drivers are facing grid penalties in Sunday's race after exceeding their allowance of new parts. Charles Leclerc, who had led a Ferrari one-two from Sainz in first practice, was half a tenth further back in third, and looks well positioned to contend for a home victory for the Italian team amid the penalties for his rivals.

Verstappen has taken his fifth internal combustion engine (ICE) of the season, of which three were allowed. The Dutchman received a 10-place penalty for taking his fourth at last month's Belgian GP, but the punishment is lowered for his second offence. Mercedes had already confirmed on Thursday that Lewis Hamilton will start from the back of the grid after taking new parts, while Verstappen's Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz are also facing penalties. Perez is taking his fourth ICE, and therefore receives a 10-place penalty, while Sainz is relegated to the back of the grid after taking a new gearbox along with several other engine parts. Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas will receive a 15-place penalty for taking new parts, while Yuki Tsunoda joins Hamilton and Sainz at the rear of the grid after taking a full slate of new parts. During final practice on Saturday, it was confirmed that Alpine's Esteban Ocon, along with both Haas drivers, would extend the group facing penalties to nine drivers. Ocon is taking a new ICE, and like Verstappen will face a five-place penalty, while Haas duo Kevin Magnussen and Mick Schumacher have received 15-place drops after taking multiple new parts.

Mark Watt took 3-12, and Brad Wheal and Michael Leask picked up two wickets each as Scotland bowled the two-time winners out for 118 after posting 160-5. West Indies were reduced to 84-8 and needed 60 runs from the final four overs, and while Jason Holder tried to attack, hitting back-to-back fours, he was last man out - caught by Chris Greaves off Watt. The platform for the bowlers was laid by a strong batting performance, George Munsey's 66no from 53 balls setting Scotland in good stead. Scotland seemed to thrive in the cold and overcast conditions at the Bellerive Oval and got off to a brisk start after they were put in to bat, racing to 52-0 in the sixth and final over of powerplay when rain forced the players off. The interruption, however, seemed to halt their momentum with experienced all-rounder Holder sending back opener Michael Jones, who made 20, and number three Matthew Cross in quick succession after the restart. However, Munsey then anchored the innings with his 53-ball knock, helping to secure a momentous victory for his side. Left in a similar circumstance to Sri Lanka on Sunday, who lost to Namibia, the West Indies now must-win in their next match when they take on Zimbabwe in Hobart on Wednesday. Scotland captain Richard Berrington was delighted with his side's performance, especially considering the lack of T20 cricket they have had of late. \"Obviously, it's a special win for us. There's a lot of hard work that's gone in over the last 12 months to get us to this point and we certainly took a lot of belief from the performances last year,\" said Berrington. \"I'm just extremely proud of the boys, going out there and showing off our skills. \"We haven't had as much T20 cricket as we might have liked but we have had a lot of 50-over cricket so it was really important for us to transfer those skills as quickly as we could. \"I'm just extremely delighted that we managed to do that. \"I thought that George Munsey and Michael Jones were excellent up front, giving us that platform and the West Indies pulled it to get it back in those middle overs. \"We had a few good cameos towards the end which we knew gave us a competitive score. I thought our bowlers were exceptional in that second innings.\" Player of the match, Munsey, added: \"I'm always looking to improve. I thought the guys out there did really well. \"We fought like anything out there in the field, the guys took their catches. \"Watty [Mark Watt] was outstanding there with his figures and the way that he bowled. He was just class. \"It was a really good performance. \"The guys did really well, coming out in the middle, from ball one going and took the pressure off me a little bit especially after that delay with the rain. They came out and did me a lot of good there.\" October 18, 2022, 4:30am Live on                          Ireland's top order crumbled as they kicked off their campaign with a 31-run defeat at the hands of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe made 174-7 after being sent in at Hobart's Bellerive Oval, a stiff total that proved beyond the boys in green as they finished on 143-9 at the end of their innings. Having needed a strong start to give themselves a chance, Ireland crashed to 22-4 and effectively drifted to rank outsiders before the end of the powerplay. Josh Little had earlier continued his impressive year, taking 3-24, while there were two wickets apiece for Mark Adair and Simi Singh. But nobody could get to grips with player of the match Sikandar Raza, who hit five sixes and five fours in his decisive knock of 82. The Irish response lacked anything as substantial as that, with three scores of 20-plus but nothing more than Curtis Campher's steady 27. The evening began well for Ireland, who opted to bowl first and saw Little open their tournament tally with his second delivery as Regis Chakabva was caught behind. The left-armer, who proved a hit with Manchester Originals in The Hundred this summer, also removed Wessly Madhevere with the new ball. Singh continued the good work by nipping out veteran duo Sean Williams and Craig Ervine to leave the score at 79-4 at the 10-over mark. Raza turned the equation in Zimbabwe's favour, however, as they piled on a further 95 runs in the second half of the innings, racing to his half-century in 26 balls. Ireland mirrored their opponents in losing a wicket from their second ball, with big-hitting Paul Stirling cleaned up by Richard Ngarava, who the picked off Lorcan Tucker in his next over. Captain Andy Balbirnie and Harry Tector both fell cheaply to Blessing Muzarabani, leaving too much for their team-mates to do. Campher, George Dockrell (24) and Gareth Delany (24) made some inroads, but the asking rate continued to climb and regular wickets stalled the momentum as the game played out to its inevitable conclusion.

A calamitous run out just before the rain delay saw Iftikhar Ahmed (22) stranded when trying to force a quick single from the non-striker's end, while Curran claimed his wicket when he got Mohammad Nawaz (10) caught behind to leave Pakistan 124-6. Asif Ali (14) was run out after a Willey delivery came off his shoulder and he was called through by playing partner Wasim, who made a quickfire 26 off 16 balls before being dismissed by Jordan with the penultimate ball of the innings. England lost Phil Salt (1) in the second over of their innings but quickly grabbed the advantage when Stokes hit back-to-back sixes as part of a 20-run over against Mohammad Hasnain, with the all-rounder reaching 36 before Wasim made the much-needed breakthrough. Pakistan squandered a routine run-out chance when Brook and Livingstone attempted a single on a misfield, with Livingstone then dropped twice in the following over before eventually being caught by Shadab to produce Wasim's second wicket. Brook raced to 45 off just 24 deliveries and Curran's 33 came from 14 balls, with the pair's aggressive batting seeing England home with 4.2 overs to spare.

Sri Lanka, viewed as the strong favourites to win Group A and advance to England's Super 12 pool after triumphing at the recent Asia Cup, were rolled for 108 in exactly 19 overs as Namibia pulled off a famous victory. Namibia's only other win over a Test nation was against Ireland during last year's T20 World Cup in the UAE. Namibia bowlers David Wiese, Bernard Scholtz, Ben Shikongo and Jan Frylinck each picked up two wickets during Sri Lanka's bungled reply - Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka top-scoring with a paltry 29 after seeing his men sink to 21-3 in the powerplay. Frylinck (44 off 28 balls) and JJ Smit (31 off 16) had earlier played crucial roles with the bat for Namibia, plundering 68 from the final five overs as they rallied their side from 93-6 to 163-7 at Kardinia Park. Namibia are now dreaming of a second successive Super 12 appearance having qualified for that stage last year in their maiden T20 World Cup but Sri Lanka can afford no further errors as they take on UAE on Tuesday and then Netherlands two days later.

What we've just achieved is above what we thought we could do and I'm very just excited at this point in time.\" Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus added: \"It's been an incredible journey.

On the defeat to Namibia, Sri Lanka captain Shanaka said: \"The execution was not there when it came to the bowling - that has been a concern for us. Once we lost three wickets in the powerplay, the game was lost.\" In the day's second game, Netherlands pipped UAE by three wickets with one ball remaining to join Namibia on two points in Group A.

Andrew Balbirnie's men enter this tournament having been beaten in 10 of their last 13 T20Is, with the caveat that they have come up against the might of India, South Africa and New Zealand in seven of those defeats. They also lost to Namibia in their sole warm-up match for this tournament. The oft-destructive opener Paul Stirling has gone 19 T20I innings without a half-century and floundered in the recent Caribbean Premier League so Ireland will need him to rediscover his touch, too. There are fewer concerns in the bowling department with seamers Mark Adair and Josh Little hoovering up wickets in T20 international cricket in 2022 and Little also impressing in The Hundred after joining Manchester Originals mid-season. However, Ireland have been dealt a late blow with another wicket-taking seamer Craig Young ruled out through injury. It will be interesting to see how keenly Ireland feel the absence of now-retired all-rounder Kevin O'Brien, a man at the heart of some of the team's highlight victories over the years, but now is the time for the youngsters to lead the charge, including talented batters Harry Tector and Gareth Delany and all-rounder Curtis Campher, the latter bagging four wickets in four balls against Netherlands in the 2021 T20 World Cup. Best result: Super 12s (2021)Coach: Shane Burger Squad: Richie Berrington (captain), Matthew Cross, George Munsey, Michael Leask, Brad Wheal, Chris Sole, Chris Greaves, Safyaan Sharif, Josh Davey, Calum MacLeod, Hamza Tahir, Mark Watt, Brandon McMullen, Michael Jones, Craig Wallace Prospects: Scotland will be aiming for back-to-back Super 12 appearances after making that stage for the first time in 2021. Focussing on the cricket will be a welcome relief for the side after a year in which governing body Cricket Scotland was found to be institutionally racist by an independent review. On the field, there has been a change at the top with Richie Berrington now captain after Kyle Coetzer stepped down from the role before going on to announce his retirement from T20I cricket. Scotland have played only two official T20Is since the 2021 World Cup, both ending in heavy defeats to New Zealand, but they have been successful in ODIs with Calum MacLeod firing two tons, five fifties and 736 runs this calendar year. George Munsey and Berrington are also destructive batters. Spinners Mark Watt and Hamza Tahir could be key as could seamer Brad Wheal, who bagged 22 wickets to help Hampshire win the Vitality Blast. With West Indies favourites to top Group B, Scotland and Ireland could be competing with each other as well as Zimbabwe for second spot - the team that finishes in that position will qualify for England's Super 12 pool. The potentially crunch clash between Scotland and Ireland is on October 19. Best result: Winners (2012, 2016)Coach: Phil Simmons Squad: Nicholas Pooran (captain), Shamarh Brooks, Yannic Cariah, Johnson Charles, Sheldon Cottrell, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Kyle Mayers, Obed McCoy, Rovman Powell, Raymon Reifer, Odean Smith Prospects: West Indies' T20 stock has dwindled since they won the tournament for the second time in Kolkata in 2016 thanks to those Carlos Brathwaite sixes - the Caribbean clan winning just one of their five Super 12 matches last year and being forced to enter at the earliest stage this term after slipping down the rankings. Gone is the tag of one of the title favourites and gone are some of the world-renowned names in Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo, former skipper Kieron Pollard and Andre Russell - retired in Pollard and Bravo's case, not selected in Gayle and Russell's. Nicholas Pooran is captain now and has a decent amount of talent at his disposal, with the skipper alongside Rovman Powell - who thumped a 51-ball ton against England in January - Evin Lewis and Johnson Charles in a powerful batting line-up. Shimron Hetmyer would have been in that too, but was dropped from the squad after missing a flight. Jason Holder and Alzarri Joseph helm the seam attack and left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein is also a canny operator with the ball - but without some of the stardust of yesteryear, Ireland, Scotland and Zimbabwe may fancy upsetting them.

Reserves: Tanaka Chivanga, Innocent Kaia, Kevin Kasuza, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Victor Nyauchi Prospects: Zimbabwe are making their first appearance at either the T20 or 50-over World Cup since 2016, with that six-year absence due to a combination of non-qualification and being suspended by the ICC for political intervention. They are back now and will have designs on the Super 12 after going unbeaten at the T20 World Cup Qualifier earlier this year - winning five from five - beating Bangladesh in a three-match series and then recording a notable ODI victory over Australia in Queensland. Sikandar Raza has been in tremendous form with the bat across the white-ball formats in 2022, with three ODI hundreds and four T20 international fifties, while he also provides a handy option with his off-spin. Spinner Ryan Burl and seamers Blessing Muzarabani and Luke Jongwe are other wicket-takers and if skipper Craig Ervine and Sean Williams can back up Raza in the batting department, then Zimbabwe should make a strong push. Ireland and Scotland may have their work cut out to finish above them. Best result: Champions (2014)Coach: Chris Silverwood Squad: Dasun Shanaka (captain), Danushka Gunathilaka, Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Charith Asalanka, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dhananjaya de Silva, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Jeffrey Vandersay, Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Lahiru Kumara, Dilshan Madushanka, Pramod Madushan. Standby: Ashen Bandara, Praveen Jayawickrema, Dinesh Chandimal, Binura Fernando, Nuwanidu Fernando Prospects: Chris Silverwood's reputation as a coach took a bit of a battering as he presided over England's 4-0 Ashes debacle last winter, with the Yorkshireman sacked post-series as part of sweeping changes to the set-up. He was subsequently given another go at international cricket with Sri Lanka and things have started rather well. The team are unbeaten in Test and ODI series under his stewardship and also won the T20-format Asia Cup last month in a real pre-World Cup fillip, with that triumph including one win over India and two victories against Pakistan. As a result, Sri Lanka will hope to not only breeze into the Super 12s but also take some big scalps if they get there. Opponents will not fancy coming up against speedy seamers Lahiru Kumara and Dushmantha Chameera, while Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis and skipper Dasun Shanaka are regular run-scores. Wanindu Hasaranga, meanwhile, has x-factor. He can bamboozle you with leg-spin and belt the ball out of the park. With all that ammunition, it would be a surprise if Sri Lanka failed to top their round-one group. If they do win it, England will await in round two. Best result: Super 12s (2021)Coach: Pierre de Bruyn Squad: Gerhard Erasmus (captain), JJ Smit, Divan la Cock, Stephan Baard, Nicol Loftie Eaton, Jan Frylinck, David Wiese, Ruben Trumpelmann, Zane Green, Bernard Scholtz, Tangeni Lungameni, Michael van Lingen, Ben Shikongo, Karl Birkenstock, Lohan Louwrens, Helao Ya France Prospects: Namibia marked their maiden T20 World Cup appearance with progression to the Super 12s last year and will fancy their chances of a repeat with skipper Gerhard Erasmus in fine fettle, the 27-year-old with hundreds in both white-ball forms in 2022 as well as six half-centuries. Veteran all-rounder David Wiese will also be a vital man with bat and ball for a side who achieved a notable 3-2 T20I series win over Zimbabwe in May. If you like great names and fast bowling, then also look out for left-arm quick Ruben Trumpelmann. He trampled Scotland's top order in last year's tournament with three wickets in the first over of the game between the sides in Abu Dhabi. Namibia have plenty of left-arm options in their squad, including JJ Smit and Jan Frylinck, and after last year's breakout tournament they are no longer a leftfield pick to make the second round. Best result: Super 10s (2014)Coach: Ryan Campbell Squad: Scott Edwards (captain), Colin Ackermann, Shariz Ahmad, Logan van Beek, Tom Cooper, Brandon Glover, Timm van der Gugten, Fred Klaassen, Bas de Leede, Paul van Meekeren, Roelof van der Merwe, Stephan Myburgh, Teja Nidamanuru, Max O'Dowd, Tim Pringle, Vikram Singh Prospects: Netherlands are competing at their fourth successive T20 World Cup and are hoping to reach round two for the first time since 2014 - a tournament which included a 45-run win over England. Four players who featured in that match remain in the Dutch squad, in batters Stephan Myburgh and Tom Cooper and seamers Logan van Beek and Timm van der Gugten - although one of their key men this year could be New Zealand-born batter Max O'Dowd. The right-hander hit two fifties in last year's tournament, proving one of the bright spots as his team lost three from three, and is the only Dutch player to score a T20 century. Skipper Scott Edwards has struck eight fifties in 15 ODI innings so far in 2022 - including three in as many matches against England in June - while all-rounder Bas de Leede has grown his reputation with white-ball fifties against New Zealand and Pakistan and a number of wickets, too. With experienced bowlers in Van Beek, Van der Gugten and Roelof van der Merwe also in their ranks, Netherlands look like being Sri Lanka's biggest challengers in this group and a strong bet to reach the Super 12s. Best result: First round (2014)Coach: Robin Singh Squad: C P Rizwan (captain), Vriitya Aravind, Chirag Suri, Muhammad Waseem, Basil Hameed, Aryan Lakra, Zawar Farid, Kashif Daud, Karthik Meiyappan, Ahmed Raza, Zahoor Khan, Junaid Siddique, Sabir Ali, Alishan Sharafu, Aayan Khan. Standby players: Sultan Ahmed, Fahad Nawaz, Vishnu Sukumaran, Adithya Shetty, Sanchit Sharma Prospects: UAE qualified in style for their first T20 World Cup since 2014 and second in their history, winning T20 World Cup Global Qualifier A with a seven-wicket victory over Ireland in the final. Opening batter Muhammad Waseem plundered 112 from 66 balls in that game, including eight sixes, to end as second-leading run-scorer in the tournament, behind only team-mate Vriitya Aravind, a real precocious talent at just 20 years of age. Rohan Mustafa, UAE's most-capped player across all formats, scored the winning run against Ireland but has been unceremoniously axed from the squad for the World Cup. Bowling-wise, pace bowler Junaid Siddique picked up 5-13 from four overs in a warm-up game against West Indies, with skipper CP Rizwan describing the bowler as \"unplayable\". He may have to be again in the World Cup if UAE are to contend for the Super 12 phase. Watch the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup live on Sky Sports from Sunday.", "england-winning-games-but-questions-remain-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-opener-vs-afghanistan": "Reports of England's white-ball demise appear to have been greatly exaggerated. After failing to win a limited-overs series during the home summer, there were a few fears - externally more than internally, you feel - that they may struggle to contend at the T20 World Cup. But any negativity has been replaced by a glow of optimism following successive T20I series victories in Pakistan and Australia. England have won their last four completed games in the format and that probably would have stretched to five if not for rain wrecking Friday's closer in Canberra. Just over a week to go until their World Cup opener, against Afghanistan in Perth, England have momentum and, perhaps more importantly, a strong notion of what their XI will be - but not everything is certain. There are still spots up for grabs, things for the decision-makers to ponder. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  We can ink in the top three. Captain Jos Buttler, obviously, will open, having returned from a calf injury he picked up during The Hundred in August with two fifties in three games in the Australia series. Arguably the best white-ball batter in the world, Buttler is a lock as he goes into his first tournament with the added pressure of being captain, not just England's gun player. Alongside him, should be Alex Hales. His inclusion instead of Phil Salt for the first T20I in Australia suggested as such and he nailed down the berth with a 51-ball 84 in that game. Two single-digit returns followed but that shouldn't alter the thinking on a player who has plundered over 1,800 runs on Australian pitches in the Big Bash and who is eager to make up for lost time having seen his England career paused between mid-2019 and September of this year for, well, you know the reasons. He was not brought back to be back-up. Then, at No 3 - unless England get off to a rollicking start and drop him down the order again - comes Dawid Malan. A man who continually delivers after being continually questioned. The debate over whether he was the player required at first drop was rampant even when he was No 1 in the world. His detractors said he scored too slowly. His response has been to score consistently. Time and time and time again, marking his 50th T20I this week with his 15th fifty-plus score. That 49-ball 82 - which does not seem too sluggish, does it? - went a long way to winning England the second T20 international, rallying the side from 54-4 to a total of 178-7. Malan's innings came three days after he was shunted down to No 7 and 24 hours after it was announced he had lost his full central contract and dropped to an incremental deal. Much like the sadly-injured Jonny Bairstow, Malan appears to flourish when he feels he has been slighted. \"I feel like I've proved my point a hell of a lot before,\" he said on Wednesday. That's the top three - now here's where it gets interesting. Ben Stokes. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  On one hand, he is Ben Stokes, an all-action superhero who can win games with the bat, ball and in the field. He did not do it with the bat against Australia this week, which is why talk about his starting spot has garnered more than a few column inches, but his mind-bending six save in the field during the second game in Canberra and subsequent wicket of Mitch Marsh were key to England's victory. Stokes' team-mate Moeen Ali said on Thursday he wanted the Test skipper in the XI \"even if he doesn't score runs\" and you sense is the overwhelming feeling within the camp. Stokes is a player to be judged on presence and moments, not numbers, which is just as well considering he averages below 20 with the bat in T20 internationals and 37.25 with the ball. The chat about Stokes potentially not playing is down to a combination of those stats; him making nine and seven in the first two games against Australia after going 19 months without a T20I appearance; and that England are blessed with middle-order batting options, many of whom bowl. Harry Brook (the one that doesn't bowl), Moeen and Liam Livingstone are likely to come in behind Stokes at five, six and seven respectively. Livingstone is yet to return from an ankle injury - he hopes to play against Pakistan on Monday - but if he is fit, he is surely in England's best XI. You do not really overlook a man with a 42-ball hundred who can also bowl crucial off and leg-spin. Omitting Stokes and pushing Brook, Moeen and Livingstone up one spot could be an option, leaving the in-form Sam Curran to slot in at No 7, but it is hard to see Stokes sitting on the sidelines, at least initially. Curran is probably vying with Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan for one place if we accept, and we probably should, that Mark Wood, Reece Topley and Adil Rashid are sure-fire picks. Wood's pace gives England X-factor; lofty left-armer Topley looks to have made himself indispensable after proving adept at the start and end of innings, and Rashid is world class, even if his current T20 international form is a tad concerning. The leg-spinner is averaging 50.50 and going at 8.91 runs an over in his last nine bowling, which spans England's seven matches in Pakistan and first two in Australia (he did not bowl in the rain-ruined final game). In fact, across the opening two fixtures in Australia his economy rate was an eye-watering 11.28, with his seven overs taken for 79 runs and just one wicket coming in that time. But much like with Stokes, you just cannot see England leaving out a player so crucial to their white-ball turnaround since 2015, especially with leg-spin such a crucial commodity in T20 cricket. An overall international T20I record of 82 scalps in 86 games at an average of 25.06 and an economy rate under eight shows Rashid's calibre. He should play and he will play - but what about Curran? The case for the left-armer's inclusion has grown after he backed up a successful tour of Pakistan (seven wickets in six games at an economy rate below 7.50) with two excellent performances against Australia - his death bowling the highlight as he successfully defended 16 in the first T20 international and 22 in the second. Is he the antidote to the late-over woes that cost England so dear in the 2016 and 2021 editions of the T20 World Cup? Perhaps. That had looked to be Jordan's role but Curran's Surrey team-mate has only just returned from a finger injury and was a little off in his sole appearance of the Australia series - his three overs going for 39 in total and his 17th over for 14 - which may have done him few favours. Woakes, meanwhile, threw a spanner in the works by shredding Australia's top order on Friday in the ultimately rain-thwarted final T20, taking advantage of the movement on offer to inflict golden ducks on Aaron Finch and Marsh with his first two balls and then banishing Glenn Maxwell later on. If Stokes stays in the XI, Rashid's figures do not become too worrisome and Livingstone proves his fitness, then we probably know 10 of England's XI to face Afghanistan. Slot No 11 will come down to whether they want Woakes' new-ball nous, Jordan's experience at the death or a man in Curran who you could conceivably chuck the ball to at any stage of the innings. The latter looks the frontrunner but with that one final warm-up against Pakistan, there is still time for things to change. What should not change is the fact that after a sketchy summer, England's white-ball side are back on track.

In a game reduced to 12 overs a side after two lengthy weather interruptions, England posted 112-2 with Buttler (65no off 41) and Ben Stokes (17no off 10) plundering 39 runs from the final 14 balls after the second rain break had come with the tourists 73-2 after 9.4 overs. Buttler smashed Josh Hazlewood for three fours and six in a 22-run 11th over, bringing up a 17th T20 international half-century, and second of the series, from 35 balls in the process. October 17, 2022, 8:30am Live on                          October 22, 2022, 11:30am Live on                          Set a revised 130, Australia slumped to 17-3 as Woakes (3-4 from two overs) removed skipper Aaron Finch (0) and Mitchell Marsh (0) for golden ducks from the first two balls of the chase and then Glenn Maxwell - opening in the absence of David Warner (neck) - towards the end of the third over. A third, match-ending downpour arrived with Australia 30-3 after 3.5 overs, just seven balls before the five overs that would have constituted a game. England had recorded successive eight-run wins in the opening two matches, firstly in Perth and then in Canberra, and now have one more warm-up, against Pakistan in Brisbane on Monday, ahead of their T20 World Cup opener against Afghanistan in Perth on October 22. Plusses from the Australia series include Buttler's two fifties after returning from a calf injury; Dawid Malan's 82 in game two; Sam Curran, who picked up five wickets combined and starred at the death in the first two games before being rested for the third; and Woakes' new-ball burst on Friday. Possible concerns are the batting form of Stokes - the left-hander making nine and seven in the first two matches before rain denied him a really lengthy hit in the third - and leg-spinner Adil Rashid, who suffered some expensive outings against Australia and also in Pakistan last month. However, a series win over the reigning World Cup champions suggests England could be a huge threat in this year's event and they still have the hard-hitting, spin-bowling Liam Livingstone to come back - Livingstone targeting Monday's warm-up as his return from an ankle injury. There seems little chance Alex Hales will be out of the XI come the Afghanistan match, with the opener possessing a fine Big Bash League record and hitting 84 from 51 balls in the series opener against Australia. But he suffered a second successive single-figure exit in Canberra, following his four on Wednesday with a second-ball duck on Friday after snicking Hazlewood to slip in the second over as he pushed away from his body. That brought Malan (23 off 19) to the middle after just eight balls and he showcased some of the timing he had displayed on the same ground two days earlier during his half-century, striking four fours in a second-wicket stand of 56 from 39 deliveries with captain Buttler. The first rain delay - which came at 49-1 after 6.2 overs and initially reduced the match to 17 overs a side - paused England's rebuild and during the three overs and two balls possible before the second one, Malan skied Pat Cummins' third slower delivery in succession to Marsh at mid-off. England seized all the momentum once the weather relented with Buttler, chiefly, and Stokes ending the innings with a flourish before Woakes shredded an Australia top order shorn of Warner, the opener sitting out this game after taking a knock to the neck fielding in the last match. Finch holed out to deep point, Marsh was pouched at short third and Maxwell spooned to mid-off, leaving England as overwhelming favourites to win the game - before the weather had the final say at Manuka Oval. Speaking about his two wickets in two balls, Woakes told BT Sport: \"It was a bit of a shock to me as well. The ball swung. I anticipated the ball to swing, but maybe not quite as much as it did in that first over. You never expect your first over to go like that to be honest.\" He added: \"We played well across the three games which was really promising for us moving forward - looking at the bigger picture with the World Cup around the corner. \"It bodes well for us. We feel pretty happy. The summer was probably a new start. Definitely feel since the Pakistan tour and then here, we're in a good place moving forward.\" England play their final T20 World Cup warm-up match against Pakistan in Brisbane on Monday, live on Sky Sports Cricket.

Rafiq was found to have been the victim of racial harassment and bullying while at Yorkshire by an investigation commissioned by the club. A number of individuals have been charged by the England and Wales Cricket Board over racism allegations made by Rafiq, while Yorkshire have been charged over their handling of those allegations. The matter is now in the hands of the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC). The Daily Mail has reported new allegations against Rafiq, who it emerged this week had been reprimanded by the CDC over an antisemitic social media post from 2011. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Mail reported claims that Rafiq repeatedly referred to a former county second XI team-mate as a Jew, made a homophobic comment towards an opposition player in 2009 and had forced overweight children to play without shirts on during a training session in 2015, and then referred to them as \"fat b*******\". Rafiq said: \"These allegations are categorically untrue. I knew as a whistleblower I would come under attack. \"What I did not expect was a never-ending, co-ordinated campaign of lies, which has caused serious risk to me and my family's safety. \"I have been vindicated over and over again, and will not be intimidated by those who seek to silence me.\" The 31-year-old has told The Cricketer he intends to move abroad because he fears for his family's safety. Rafiq has repeatedly called for CDC hearings examining the racism allegations he made and Yorkshire's handling of them to be held in public, and there is understood to be growing confidence that at least the latter part of the process will be public. Yorkshire are understood to favour a public hearing, and the ECB has taken a neutral stance on the matter.

Warner, 35, was banned from captaining by CA for the role he played in Australia's ball-tampering scandal at Newlands in 2018, an offence which also saw him suspended from the elite game for one year. There have been calls from players, including Test skipper Pat Cummins, for the leadership ban to be dropped to allow Warner to be considered to replace Aaron Finch as one-day international skipper. Any player who accepts a sanction under the current code, as Warner did, forgoes the right to a later review of the punishment, but the CA board on Friday asked the body's head of integrity to propose an amendment to it. \"The amendment would allow a person to request a penalty that they had accepted be reviewed after an appropriate period of time,\" CA said in a statement. \"The onus would be on the applicant to prove they had undergone genuine reform relevant to the offence they were sanctioned for. \"Any review would not revisit the original sanction, other than suspension of a penalty in recognition of genuine reform.\" Warner, speaking in Canberra during Australia's third T20I against England, said: \"It is what it is. At the end of the day I've just got to accept what decision is handed down. There is talk I might be be able to have a chat with the integrity unit. \"If it's possible, I am happy to sit down with them, chew the fat and see where we are at. If it does get overturned then we have to go from there. For me, I'm a leader in this team no matter what. It doesn't matter if you've got a 'c' or a 'vc' next to your name. You've got to put your best foot forward and lead by example. Asked about captaining the white-ball side, he said: \"It would be a privilege [to captain Australia] if it ever presented itself. \"For me, it's about focussing on the next game and what I have to do for the team. At this point in time that's what I have to do.\" CA chairman Lachlan Henderson and chief executive Nick Hockley signalled the move after CA's annual general meeting on Thursday. Hockley said: \"We are looking at sanctions to be reviewed for good behaviour and growth after a period of time. Pending the discussion, there would then need to be a revision of the code and that would need to be approved by the board.\" Henderson said the review would be undertaken as quickly as possible to allow Warner to be considered in discussions about future leadership positions.

Stokes has been dismissed for nine and seven in the opening two T20 internationals against Australia, both of which England won by eight runs to earn a series victory with a game to spare. Test skipper Stokes still played a big role in England's triumph in Canberra on Wednesday evening, dismissing Australia's top-scorer Mitchell Marsh after previously denying him a six with a staggering stop on the boundary.

Hazlewood said of England: \"They've got the wood over us in the last few series, they're a quality outfit. \"I still think they're pretty close to the benchmark with India. It's a good challenge to have leading into the World Cup and playing three games against them.\" Moeen added: \"I don't think it's a mental edge on Australia. We know under pressure in group games in the World Cup they will be completely different. \"It's whoever turns up on the day.

Moeen said: \"The summer was a natural transition from Morgs [50-over World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan]. The team was going through change and was always going to have a dip. We played two very good teams. I wasn't worried and I don't think Jos was worried. \"Under Morgs everything was a lot more structured.

Hopefully white-ball cricket can get recognised as Test match cricket does. \"We'd like to be rewarded for our performances for England, that's what contracts are for, and if you're ranked top-five in the world for three years, you'd hope you get recognised with a white-ball contract but that's not how it works. \"You have players here who are the leading wicket-takers in the history of the game [Jordan is England's highest T20 wicket-taker] who don't have a contract but those are decisions I don't make. \"Keysie [Rob Key] and I have had that chat already. There's nothing you can do about it. It's still an honour to play for England and I want to try to help win as many games as I can.\" Malan was dropped down the order to No 7 during England's victory in the first T20 international against Australia in Perth after the side made a rapid start through openers Buttler and Alex Hales. But the left-hander was back at his customary spot of No 3 in the second game, with his 14th T20I half-century helping his team clinch successive eight-run wins. The 35-year-old added: \"I feel like I've proved my point a hell of a lot before. \"Ultimately, the way this team is balanced, if we get to a certain stage in the game, I think everyone's very flexible in the way they're going to bat. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"It was the same at the last World Cup, we chop and change depending on whether we want a certain player in at a certain time, especially if we get a good start. As soon as we get a good start, the whole team pretty much pads up and waits for a nod.\" On Malan, team-mate Moeen Ali said: \"People don't give him the credit because we have such explosive players but the guy's a special player. \"I feel people are on his back at times for no reason. He always scores runs and he scores them quickly. He's a great player, underestimated massively.\" Our live blog of England's third T20 international against Australia, in Canberra, will get under way at 8.45am on Friday ahead of a 9.10am start.

Sam Curran is not in that category but he is making a tremendous case to be involved when Buttler's boys begin their World Cup campaign against Afghanistan in Perth on October 22. Death bowling has cost England in the previous two editions of the tournament. It cost them the trophy in India in 2016 as Carlos Brathwaite smoked Ben Stokes for four consecutive sixes in the last over. It then cost them a spot in the final last year in the UAE as New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell and Jimmy Neesham pumped Rashid, Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes for boundaries to take the Black Caps to a target of 167 with six balls to spare when they had needed 57 from 24 deliveries. Back-end bowling has proved England's Kryptonite, then, but not for Curran in the last two T20 internationals against Australia. Handed death bowling duties, he has delivered, lifting his side to successive eight-run victories and a series win with a game to spare. Curran successfully defended 16 in the final over of Sunday's opening fixture in Perth, recovering from being walloped for a first-ball four by Matthew Wade by conceding only three runs and claiming two wickets during the subsequent five deliveries. Then, in game two in Canberra on Wednesday, Curran severely dented Australia's hopes by bowling the hard-hitting Tim David in a three-run 18th over, before ending them when he defended 22 from the final over. Once again, pressure was put on by a first-ball boundary - Pat Cummins blazing the left-armer for six over the leg-side. Once again, Curran rebounded - limiting Cummins and Wade to ones and twos as England took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Buttler said of Curran: \"He's one of these bowlers who wants to be in the thick of it in those big moments. We needed to get David out to win the game, and Sam did that for us.\" Curran did not make either Nasser Hussain's or Mark Butcher's sides when the Sky Sports Cricket experts were charged with selecting their England World Cup XIs a little over a week ago - but the pundits could be having second thoughts now. All of a sudden, Jordan looks vulnerable. He has been one of England's T20 death bowlers for years and bounced back well during the home summer after his T20 World Cup nightmare against New Zealand last November when his 17th over in Abu Dhabi went for 23 - two sixes, a four and two wides among the game-changing damage. But his three overs against Australia in Canberra - in what was his first outing since overcoming a finger injury sustained in The Hundred - were plundered for 39 runs, with his death over, the 17th, taken for 14 as the destructive David followed a four with a six. Curran's late shows have helped England win games, yet he is also a new-ball option if the ball is swinging and adept in the middle overs with cutters and bouncers, too. In Canberra, he removed Australia's Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis between overs eight and 12. If you add in Curran's batting ability, then there are a number of places the all-rounder could slot into the England XI, not just instead of Jordan. Say it quietly, but perhaps even in place of Ben Stokes, with the Test captain yet to find his best form since landing in Australia. A scratchy run-a-ball nine in Perth was followed by an 11-ball seven in Canberra for a player who has now played 30 innings in T20 internationals with a top-score of 47 and an average of 19 and who has played the short format so little in recent times. Pushing Stokes up the order - he featured at No 3 in the first game against Australia and No 4 in the second - was seen as a way to unlock his abilities but that has not borne fruit so far and it's not like England are short of options. Moeen Ali, Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone (if fit) could also shunt up spots, behind the top three of Buttler, Alex Hales and Dawid Malan, leaving Curran to come in at No 7. It's one way England could go but probably not the way they will go with Stokes - whose class, composure and clarity of thought helped win England the 50-over World Cup in 2019 - set to at least start the tournament. Speaking on the latest Sky Sports Cricket Podcast, CricViz's Freddie Wilde acknowledged Stokes' big-game experience and temperament, saying: \"I think England will start with Stokes for those reasons, while I also think he is suited to Australian conditions with the pace and bounce. \"But if he has a few quiet games and Curran is on the bench - which he could be - that debate will gather some momentum. \"It is a tough call because Stokes has hardly played any T20 cricket in the last 18 months whereas Curran has played around the world and done fantastically well. It's a live debate.\" There remains a strong possibility that Stokes and Curran could be in England's XI against Afghanistan, particularly with Livingstone still facing a fight to be fit for that match as he recovers from an ankle injury. The Lancashire man is targeting Monday's final warm-up game, against Pakistan in Brisbane, as his comeback fixture but there is no guarantee he will be ready for that clash or the World Cup opener five days later. If Livingstone is not fit, it is hard to envisage Curran not playing. And if Curran performs in Friday's final T20I against reigning World Cup champions Australia in the way he has done in the first two, then it will become increasingly difficult to see how England can leave him out when the main event comes around.

Opener Jennings returns for the first time since February 2019 after a good summer with Lancashire, where he was top run-scorer in the LV= Insurance County Championship with 1,233 in 17 innings. Lees has been axed after averaging 25.15 across 13 Test innings during the 2022 home summer, with the Durham man only passing fifty on two occasions.

It is the first time an England team has played red-ball cricket in Pakistan since 2005 and comes off the back of a T20 series, which England won 4-3. England won six out of seven Tests at home this year, beating India, New Zealand and South Africa along the way, with their sole defeat coming against the Proteas at Lord's. Rob Key, the managing director of England men's cricket, said: \"We are looking forward to touring Pakistan as a Test team for the first time since 2005. It will be a historic tour and a compelling series against a good side. \"The selectors have picked a squad for the conditions we can expect in Pakistan. There is a strong blend of youth and experience and players who will adapt well to the types of pitches we are likely to get across the three-match series. \"I wish the players every success, especially those new to the squad and those returning after a period of time away.\" Three-day warm-up: England v Lions, November 23-25, Zayed Cricket Complex, Abu Dhabi First Test: Pakistan v England, December 1-5, Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Rawalpindi Second Test: Pakistan v England, December 9-13, Multan Cricket Stadium, Multan Third Test: Pakistan v England, December 17-21, National Stadium, Karachi Jennings averaged of 72.52 for Lancashire this season, hitting five centuries, including 318 against Somerset.

I did things this year I've never done before,\" Jennings said before the Test squad was announced. \"I turned 30 this summer, and I think age and maturity is a big factor. Between 28 and 35 is when you hit your peak as a batter - a lot of guys have scored a lot of runs in that period, it's the best time of a batter's life. \"What Ben Stokes and the rest of the squad have done incredibly well is back guys publicly, and that's absolutely fantastic.

The England international burst onto the scene in The Hundred in 2021, scoring a half-century on her Lord's debut at the age of 16 and then helping Oval Invincibles win the title later that summer. Capsey, now 18, built on that in 2022, making her England debut in the T20 and 50-over formats, racking up 13 appearances for her country in total, hitting a first international fifty during the Commonwealth Games, and playing a key role as Invincibles retained the Hundred trophy.

I think she is a superstar in the making, she really is.\" This 'superstar in the making' will be a Melbourne Star over the next month or so having signed for that franchise in the WBBL. Capsey will be hoping to propel her team to a maiden title, with Stars losing in the final in 2020/21 and failing to make the play-offs in each of the other six seasons. The youngster will be joined in the Women's Big Bash League by three more England T20 international regulars in left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone, opening batter Danni Wyatt and wicketkeeper Amy Jones. Ecclestone, the top-ranked ODI and T20I bowler in the world, has been signed by a Sydney Sixers side looking to make the play-offs for the first time since 2018/19. Wyatt is at Brisbane Heat, Jones at Sydney Thunder. The tournament will also provide Tammy Beaumont and Lauren Winfield-Hill with an opportunity to push for England T20 recalls ahead of the World Cup in South Africa in February. Beaumont - the ICC's Women's T20I cricketer of the year for 2021 - was dropped from England's T20 team this summer as the side opted for a top three of Wyatt, Sophia Dunkley and Capsey. England head coach Lisa Keightley said at the time she wanted \"dynamic\" players and Beaumont will hope to display that trait in the WBBL by raising her career strike-rate in that competition from its current 94.23. Winfield-Hill, meanwhile, has not played for England in a T20 international since February 2020 but showed her short-form credentials during Invincibles' title-winning campaign in The Hundred, scoring 219 runs in seven innings at a healthy strike-rate of 136.02. Effervescent fast bowler Issy Wong - who made her Test, ODI and T20I debuts this summer - was also due to play in the Big Bash, for Hobart Hurricanes, but has been withdrawn by the ECB to manage a back issue.

England posted 178-7 in Canberra as top-scorer Malan (82 off 49 balls) and Moeen (44 off 27) resuscitated their side from 54-4 in the ninth over with a stand of 92 from 52 deliveries against a full-strength Australia bowling attack featuring Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa, all of whom had been rested for the series opener. Malan marked his 50th T20 international with a 31-ball half-century, his 14th in the format, before being dropped on 54, while Moeen punished Glenn Maxwell for shelling him on one at backward point. Curran then bagged 3-25 in the chase, including the key wicket of the destructive Tim David (40 off 23) in a three-run 18th over, as Australia could only muster 170-6 in reply - Mitchell Marsh (45 off 29) top-scoring against an England side impressive with the ball and slick in the field. Australia needed 22 at the start of Curran's final over and their hopes were raised when Cummins creamed the seamer for six over the leg-side first delivery but, just as in Sunday's first T20 international in Perth, Curran completed the job as England earned successive eight-run wins. England will look to complete a 3-0 series sweep in Canberra on Friday (9.10am UK time) before they play a final warm-up game against Pakistan in Brisbane on Monday ahead of their T20 World Cup opener versus Afghanistan on October 22, at Optus Stadium in Perth. Left-armer Curran flourished with the ball and England were indebted to two left-handers with the bat, in Malan and Moeen, after the rest of the top six failed to fire; Buttler out for 17 from 13 balls after three early fours and Alex Hales (4), Ben Stokes (7) and Harry Brook (4) all dismissed cheaply. Hales - who top-scored for England in Perth with 84 from 51 balls - and Brook were caught off medium-pacer Marcus Stoinis (3-34), the same bowler who ended Malan's elegant knock in the final over of the innings when substitute fielder Steve Smith pouched at wide long-on. Stokes suffered a second single-figure dismissal in a row, bowled on the slog-sweep by Zampa as the Australia leg-spinner rocked his middle stump with a flat, quick delivery - but excelled in the field with a stunning boundary save that stopped a certain Marsh six. Malan, meanwhile, was superb, reaffirming his class with the bat having slid down the order to No 7 during Sunday's match. With Buttler having been the first to depart - ballooning Cummins to short third in the fourth over after successfully overturning an lbw dismissal in the second - England found themselves four down before the halfway point of the innings after being inserted by Aaron Finch at the toss. Malan and Moeen added impetus, though, with an excellent fifth-wicket partnership, although they were aided by Australian sloppiness in the field, with half-chances mixed in with opportunities that should have been taken. Maxwell's early drop of Moeen was followed by David - once again preferred to Smith in the home side's XI - shelling Malan on 54 on the long-off boundary, David tipping the ball over the rope to gift Malan one of the four sixes he struck on the evening, to go with seven fours. Smith was called upon in the field, however, replacing Warner for the latter stages of the innings after his team-mate landed on his head and back attempting to catch a Moeen six over deep point. David atoned somewhat for grassing Malan when he caught Moeen off Zampa at wide long-off before Starc bowled Curran (8) around his legs, Malan holed out off Stoinis and Chris Jordan (7no) smashed the final ball of the innings, bowled by Stoinis, for six over the leg-side. Warner's tumble in the field left no lasting damage with the opener fit to bat after passing a concussion test but he lasted just 11 balls, slicing Reece Topley (1-35) to cover as he faltered after fifties in his last two innings. Skipper Finch - back opening after featuring at No 3 or 4 in his previous three knocks - the returning Maxwell (8) and Stoinis (22 off 13) were also ousted by England left-armers; Finch caught off David Willey at mid-off and Maxwell and Stoinis hauling Curran into the deep on the leg-side. Marsh shared stands of 40 and 23 with Stoinis and David respectively but when he whipped Stokes to Curran at deep square at the start of the 15th over to leave Australia five down and needing 65 from 35 balls, England seemed favourites. David gave England some nervy moments before he was bowled by Curran's leg-stump yorker, while Cummins hinted at a final-over turnaround when he boomed the same bowler into the stands - but Curran conceded only seven runs from that point as he once again pressed his claims to be in England's first-choice T20 World Cup XI. Jordan, the man whose place Curran could take, went for 39 from three overs in his first outing since overcoming a finger injury, while leg-spinner Adil Rashid's four overs were taken for 38 - Rashid's form potentially a slight concern for England ahead of the World Cup with the Yorkshireman also leaking runs during the recent tour of Pakistan. England's Jonny Bairstow, speaking to BT Sport... \"Any time you get a series win in Australia, it's got to be celebrated. The boys were really calm - that was one of the things that was outstanding. I thought it was a well-rounded performance and they'll be delighted. \"From the batting display and the calmness that Dawid [Malan] and Mo [Ali] showed to create that partnership and get us up to that score, all the way to the calmness and skill that Sammy [Curran] showed at the end to execute. \"In the field, people throwing themselves around. We've won by eight runs and those eight runs come from those efforts from everyone. You end up winning by eight, rather than losing by one.\" Player of the Match, Dawid Malan... \"I'm over the moon. It's nice to score runs and contribute to a win. Knowledge of the grounds helps, but I didn't have a great Big Bash, to be honest. I've found my rhythm. Hopefully I can keep the runs coming.\" England skipper Jos Buttler \"It's really satisfying. Dawid [Malan] has been really consistent and has done it against every attack around the world. Sam [Curran] wants to be in the thick of things at the important moments. We had to get Tim David out to win the game.\" England's Moeen Ali speaking to BT Sport... \"We spoke about staying in the moment, Dawid [Malan] played superbly, it was a crucial partnership. We take a lot of confidence from this win, it's huge for our team with a lot of young players. Pakistan was big for us, winning two here, Jos [Buttler] coming back and in form.

Along with her responsibilities in Australia, she took charge of the Trent Rockets for a second year in The Hundred, losing in the Eliminator to the Southern Brave by two runs. Before Keightley took over, Beams was in contention to take over from Mark Robinson. \"Salliann has been in Australia for a long time and it felt when she left like a bit of a talent drain,\" Rainford-Brent said. \"But it does mean she is immersed in their mindset, their culture and has a real understanding of how they play their cricket.

But Stokes is yet to score a half-century in 29 T20 international innings and has played the format infrequently over the last few years due to injury, his break from the game and Test commitments.

Stokes and Buttler as a left-hand, right-hand combination solved a lot of problems. \"England didn't go down that route and it has now left them in a situation where they are trying to get Stokes higher up the order, where he is better suited. But you have Buttler, Alex Hales and Dawid Malan as locks in the top three so the highest you can get Stokes is No 4. \"I think he will still do quite well in this World Cup because he enjoys pace and bounce as a batsman but it is a difficult role in the middle order and will be a real test of his credentials.\" Liam Livingstone is hoping to be fit for England's final warm-up game against Pakistan on October 17 before the team begin their World Cup campaign against Afghanistan on October 22.

Hussain said of Livingstone: \"I think he needs to play a bit of cricket but he gets into my side just because of the dynamic of someone coming in lower down the order. \"When we started doing T20, everyone said, 'don't worry about your No 7, they only face seven deliveries, you might as well play the extra bowler'. \"But if you have a No 7 like Kieron Pollard, Livingstone, Moeen Ali, Stokes or whoever, that gives you that extra batting depth and it means that top six can absolutely go for it.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  - Is death bowling an issue for England? - Could West Indies be upset in round one? - Will Jasprit Bumrah's injury force India to bat more aggressively? - Who are the favourites to win an 'open' tournament? - Are South Africa the dark horses?

Cricket Discipline Commission adjudicator Chris Tickle reprimanded each of the five former or current cricketers and they will face no further action. Wyatt, Brooks, Jones, Rafiq and Gale have each admitted the breaches. Sky Sports News has contacted all five cricketers for a response. England Women cricketers Wyatt and Jones' charge relates to a 'blackface' Instagram post from 2013. Former Yorkshire bowler Rafiq and coach Gale have been reprimanded for anti-Semitic posts on Facebook and Twitter respectively. Somerset player Brooks' charge relates to tweets directed at England's Tymal Mills and former cricketer Stewart Laudat which included racist language. Rafiq - whose allegations of institutional racism at Yorkshire rocked cricket last year - issued an unreserved apology following the announcement of the disciplinary action, saying he remains \"ashamed and embarrassed\" by his post from 2011. He tweeted: \"This summer, I unequivocally accepted a charge from the ECB regarding my antisemitic social media post from 2011.

The 29-year-old has not played since August 23 after suffering ankle ligament damage following an innocuous trip on a kerb and is set to miss England's final two T20s against Australia this week, in Canberra on Wednesday and Friday. The target is now Monday's clash with Pakistan in Brisbane ahead of England's World Cup opener against Afghanistan in Perth the following Saturday - but the Lancashire man will not rush his comeback. Livingstone told PA Media: \"In my head I'm aiming for the warm-up game against Pakistan. [My ankle] is improving really quickly.

I'd pretty much played three years of solid cricket so it's been nice to spend a bit of time at home. \"Something I've always found difficult is when the right time is to have that break.

It would be a risky one to go for so early in the trip.'\" That was England skipper Jos Buttler's response when asked why he did not attempt to have Matthew Wade dismissed for obstructing the field during Sunday's eight-run victory over Australia in Perth. During a thrilling finale as the home side ultimately failed to chase down England's 208-6 and slipped 1-0 down in the three-match series, Wade seemed to impede Mark Wood as the bowler tried to take a return catch after Wade had top-edged a delivery onto his helmet. \"I was just looking at the ball,\" said Buttler, after Wade was eventually dismissed for 21 from 15 balls and Australia ended on 200-9. \"It's quite hard, I don't know what I'm appealing for really, I could maybe have asked some of the other boys to see if they had a better view. \"I didn't really see what happened and we've only just got to Australia so I thought just carry on in the game.\" Buttler answered \"maybe, yeah\", when quizzed on whether he would take a different approach if a similar situation arose during the teams' T20 World Cup meeting at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on October 28. England assistant coach - and former Australia batter - Mike Hussey says he would have taken a harder line than Buttler in Sunday's match, although did question whether the decision could have been made by the umpires. Hussey told The Age and Sydney Morning Herald: \"Obstructing the field doesn't happen very often at all... I probably would have appealed. \"It would have been interesting if it was just left to the third umpire to make a decision, because I felt as though [Wade] certainly impeded the bowler from a chance to take the catch. \"It almost needed to be taken out of Jos' hands and just be left to the third umpire or the umpires out there to make a call on what they thought.\" Sky Sports Cricket's Nasser Hussain said: \"Watching from home, it was obvious that Wade was obstructing. I would have appealed - you have to appeal in the laws of the game to get the decision to go your way. \"But Jos was just looking up at the ball and I don't think he, live and in the moment, would have seen the obstruction. Had he seen it properly, I think he would absolutely have appealed. \"He said afterwards that maybe in a World Cup final he would have appealed. I see England and Australia as always a massive game and if you think it's out, appeal for it.\" Australia's Marcus Stoinis suggested the blow to the head might have momentarily confused Wade, saying: \"It's chaos when you're hit on the head and you're running around and you don't know where the ball is.\" Buttler (68 off 32 balls) - playing his first match since August after overcoming a calf injury - and Alex Hales (84 off 51) thumped 132 for England's first wicket from just 68 balls after the tourists had been inserted by Aaron Finch. Australia, led by David Warner's 73 from 44 balls, were on course to overhaul that, only for Wood, Reece Topley and Sam Curran to impress with the ball at the death - Wood's three wickets including that of Warner and Curran taking two wickets in a final over that went for only seven runs. Australia rested seamers Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, leg-spinner Adam Zampa and all-rounder Glenn Maxwell in Perth but all five could return in Canberra, the venue for the final two matches in the series. Buttler said: \" Australia seemed to have it under control and we needed to find ways to take wickets but we did that and showed great character. \"We can take some really good confidence from that.

When the team line-up for their tournament opener against Afghanistan at the same venue on October 22, it looks certain to be Hales and Jos Buttler up top, with the pair looking to replicate what they achieved at the Optus Stadium on Sunday in an opening partnership of 132 from 68 balls. There was never any doubt that Buttler, fitness-permitting, would be in England's top two and he displayed his white-ball mastery with 68 from 32 balls in his his first knock since August having overcome a calf problem. But the emergence of Phil Salt - who hit England's highest individual score of 88 from 41 balls in the recent 4-3 T20I triumph in Pakistan - had put pressure on Hales and suggested that it was not a given that the now reintegrated Nottinghamshire slugger would be in England's World Cup XI. It seems a given now after he pumped 84 from 51 deliveries - an innings which contained 12 fours and three sixes - and continued his love affair with Australian conditions. Hales has swathes of experience Down Under, amassing over 1,800 runs across his 60 career innings in the Big Bash League at a strike rate over 150. That was a principal reason, along with his experience, why Hales' three-year exile for off-field reasons was brought to an end once Jonny Bairstow - the man set to open with Buttler in the World Cup - was ruled out after an untimely fall on a Yorkshire golf course that resulted in a broken leg. On Hales opening at the World Cup, Buttler said: \"Things change quickly in sport but he's got the first crack at it, at the minute. \"It was a really tough call, we spent a lot of time debating it and thinking about it. It was only really Alex's record in Australia that got him ahead. \"He's settled back in really well and he played fantastically well here. He's a really destructive player, he accesses all areas of the ground and he's intimidating to bowl at.\" In his temporary role as pundit, Bairstow used words like \"clinical\" and \"exhibition\" to describe the riotous opening stand between Buttler and Hales, with 22 boundaries coming in their partnership all told. Buttler reaching fifty from 25 balls, Hales a lick slower at 29 deliveries. Hales dubbed Buttler the \"best white-ball player in the world\" during a half-time chinwag with the host broadcaster but Hales is a fearsome proposition in his own right. Tall and with long levers, he can find the fence, and indeed smash you over it, even when he does not middle the ball. There were a few hacked boundaries on Sunday, with top-edges, inside-edges and far from the sweetest of connections earning him runs. But there were also crisp sixes back over the heads of Daniel Sams and Marcus Stoinis, a belted four off Cameron Green over cover and delicate placement as he caressed Nathan Ellis to the backward-point boundary. Hales looks just as home on bouncy Australian pitches as he does at his home ground Trent Bridge. Hales in England's T20 side just seems to work. He was the first player to score a T20 international ton for the men's team - his 116 not out against Sri Lanka in 2014 remains their highest score in the format - and has been involved in all four of their highest T20I opening partnerships of all time. Sunday's salvo with Buttler ranks second on that list, behind only the unbeaten 143 he and Michael Lumb had put on against New Zealand in Wellington in February 2013. Hales has racked up the T20 milestones for England, then, but Ben Stokes has not - except for the unwanted one of never having passed fifty for his country in the format after a scratchy run-a-ball nine against Australia. There are caveats to that, with Stokes' previous T20 International appearance coming in March 2021, added to the fact that he had only batted in the top three on three occasions prior this match. When he trotted out at first drop on Sunday, there was no real time for him to settle in. The sight of Stokes heading to the wicket as opposed to usual No 3 Dawid Malan showed the plan was to pummel Australia further and build on the rapid start given to them by Hales and Buttler. Stokes couldn't quite manage that, with his innings containing as many dropped catches and smashes to the chin - Stokes clocked under the grille after failing to nail an attempted reverse sweep - as boundaries. His solitary four edged rather than middled before he holed out to long-on. The left-hander was bound to be rusty having not played an innings at all since England's final Test of the summer against South Africa in mid-September and not played a white-ball knock since making five in his retirement one-day international against the Proteas in July. Getting the best out of Stokes has been viewed as key if England are to go deep in this T20 World Cup and the slot they have earmarked is No 4, as opposed to the opening role where he smashed an IPL ton in 2020 and the No 5/No 6 berth where his impact has previously been limited in T20s. Stokes is such a talented and cerebral player that he will probably make it work - No 4, on paper, seems perfect for him, in that he can take the game on if necessary but also assesses and try to fix the situation if wickets fall in the powerplay, just as they did in all three of England's losses in Pakistan. England are still seeking how to maximise Stokes in this format, whereas they know full well how to get the best out of Hales. Plonk him up top and let him loose. He missed his nation's Stokes-inspired 50-over World Cup triumph in 2019 but could now be crucial in their pursuit of T20 silverware.

Hales (84 off 51 balls) struck 12 fours and three sixes after being preferred to Phil Salt as Buttler's opening partner, while the skipper (68 off 32) managed eight fours and four sixes - four boundaries of which came in the opening over of the game - in his first outing since August as the pair shared an opening stand of 132 from 68 balls in a total of 208-6. Australia looked on course to top that as David Warner (73 off 44 balls) shared quickfire half-century stands with Mitchell Marsh (36 off 26) and Marcus Stoinis (35 off 15) to reduce the requirement to 51 from 35 balls with seven wickets in hand at Optus Stadium. However, Wood (3-34) struck twice in the 15th over before picking up the key wicket of Warner at the end of the three-run 17th - a few balls after the tourists opted not to appeal for Matthew Wade out obstructing the field after he appeared to impede Wood's attempts at snaring a return catch. Curran (2-35) then conceded only seven runs and took two wickets, including Wade, in a final over which had begun with Australia requiring 16 as the hosts were limited to 200-9 and England moved 1-0 up ahead of Wednesday's second match in Canberra (9.10am UK time). Australia had pegged England back with a cluster of wickets towards the end of their innings - seamer Nathan Ellis returning figures of 3-20 as the tourists managed 49 runs from the final six overs. Test skipper Ben Stokes made a scratchy nine from nine balls from the No 3 spot in his first T20I since March 2021, with the left-hander dropped on one at mid-on before being hit on the chin attempting a reverse sweep. The second T20I at Manuka Oval is followed by a third on Friday at the same venue, before England play a final warm-up against Pakistan in Brisbane next Monday ahead of their T20 World Cup opener against Afghanistan in Perth on October 22. All eyes were on England's top order at Optus Stadium, with Hales given the nod over Salt, and Buttler playing his first game after two months out with a calf problem. Both flourished en route to 29 and 25-ball half-centuries respectively, with Buttler drilling Cameron Green for four fours in a 16-run opening over as the Australia seamer paid the price for overpitching. Buttler, whose other highlights included a ramped six off Kane Richardson and back-to-back leg-side maximums off leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson, was dropped on 30 by a diving Mitchell Marsh at short third after an attempted ramp off Ellis, while some of Hales' boundaries were edged. But England were brutal after being inserted, racing to 50-0 after five overs and 128-0 after 11 - during which time 21 boundaries were amassed - before Buttler plinked the impressive Ellis to mid-off in the 12th. Hales continued to find the fence while Stokes, pushed up the order as England try to get the best out of a man who is yet to score a T20I fifty, stuttered - Stokes' sole boundary a slashed effort down to deep third. Stokes and Hales were both caught in the deep in successive overs as Australia's second-string bowling attack - seamers Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and spinners Adam Zampa and Glenn Maxwell were rested for the series opener - began to stem the run-scoring. Harry Brook (10 off 12), Moeen Ali (10 off 7) and Sam Curran (2 off 5) all came and went before Chris Woakes (13no off 5) took England over 200 in a T20I in Australia for the first time with a final-over four off Richardson. Woakes added gloss to the total with a monster six over deep midwicket while batting with Dawid Malan (2no), who had slid down the order to No 7 after his side's rapid start. Green's day then took another sour turn - the all-rounder caught behind for one off Reece Topley (2-36) after a successful review having seen his three overs in England's innings taken for a combined 38. However, Warner followed on from his 41-ball 75 against West Indies on Friday with another half-century - this 29-ball fifty including three successive fours off England speedster Wood in the fourth over. Warner found fine allies in Marsh and Stoinis but was only alongside skipper Aaron Finch (12 off 7) fleetingly with the latter run out after some superb work from Curran in the deep, two overs after Marsh was bowled having failed to read an Adil Rashid googly. The game changed when Wood picked up Stoinis - two deliveries after being belted for six by him over midwicket - and another power-hitter Tim David (0 off 3) in the 15th over and then Warner in the 17th, Warner letting out an audible groan as he slashed to the man at deep point. A gripping finish, during which the Wade incident occurred, wickets tumbled and boundaries kept Australia just about afloat, went England's way. Topley's 19th over went for six and included the wicket of Daniel Sams (6), before Curran removed Wade and Ellis (0) in the last over. England captain, Jos Buttler... \"Australia seemed to have it under control and we needed to find ways to take wickets but we did that and showed great character.

Luthra, who played youth-level cricket for Scotland and now runs a London-based media company, says he was driven to take on the role after feeling \"anger, deep upset and frustration\" at 448 examples of institutional racism being uncovered within the Scottish game. Cricket Scotland's previous board resigned shortly before the findings of the review were published, with Luthra telling Sky Sports News that his \"No 1 priority\" is to appoint an independent and diverse board of directors. Luthra said: \"I have arrived in a very problematic, complicated situation and there are some deep problems, but I am very optimistic about the future and ready to rebuild the organisation. I am ready for the challenge. \"Why I got involved was driven and fuelled by my anger, deep upset and frustration about what I was hearing and reading from the report. \"The more I read and the more I spoke to people, the angrier and the more upset I got about the experiences the victims had gone through.

The men's national team are currently preparing for the T20 World Cup in Australia later this month - a tournament they reached the second round of last year in the UAE - while they defeated England in a one-day international in Edinburgh in 2018. Luthra added: \"We have a lot of talent and potential in this country and we have had some great results as a nation over the last couple of years. \"In order to take the next step we need to commercialise and reduce the reliance on government funding.

Bairstow scored four centuries in six Tests for the England men's side this summer, amassing 681 runs at an average of 75.66 with a strike rate of 96.59 as he played a major part in his country's red-ball revival under captain Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum. The Yorkshireman struck a scintillating 136 from 92 balls in the second Test against New Zealand and followed that up with 162 and 71 not out in the final fixture against the Black Caps as England earned a 3-0 series sweep. Bairstow continued his stunning form with 106 and an unbeaten 114 in the rearranged fifth Test against India, a game his team won by seven wickets. All told, England won five of the six Tests in which Bairstow played this summer. The 33-year-old - who is currently recovering from a broken leg sustained playing golf which will rule him out until 2023 - has won two awards this week with the PCA accolade coming days after he was named England Men's Player of the Year by the Cricket Writers' Club.

Sciver hit two hundreds in the 50-over World Cup in the early part of the year, her first Test century against South Africa in June and and then notched 228 runs in six innings in The Hundred while playing for Trent Rockets, with her runs in that competition coming at an average of 76. Sciver - who opted to miss England's series against India in September in order to prioritise her mental health - was also named England Women's Player of the Year by the Cricket Writers' Club earlier this week. She said: \"I've been really happy with my form this year. It's weird to think the World Cup was this year, too. The two centuries in the World Cup were really special and the Test innings against South Africa was brilliant, too. \"The Hundred had a great second year, the cricket and atmospheres were brilliant again, and the Rockets had a better year than last which is very pleasing. Hopefully we can improve next year.\" Brook and Kemp also scooped gongs, with Brook winning Men's Young Player of the Year for the second season in a row - the first time that feat has been achieved since Sir Alastair Cook in 2005 and 2006. Yorkshire Brook, 23, made his Test debut for England in September - coming into the side following Bairstow's injury - after piling up 976 County Championship runs at an average of 107.40. Brook was then England's leading run-scorer in the recent 4-3 T20I series win in Pakistan, with his 238 runs at an average of 79.33 and strike rate of 163.01 seemingly inking him into his country's T20 World Cup first XI when the tournament starts later this month. Brook said: \"A lot of people have a good year but to be able to back it up and be consistent for a couple of seasons is really nice. It's great to follow in Alastair Cook's footsteps, he was a genius and I just hope I can continue scoring runs. \"It's such a good feeling to get this recognition because it's from your own team-mates and opposition, which is a big achievement, so I'm honoured to have won it twice. \"Being involved in a World Cup is what dreams are made of. It's special being able to represent England at a World Cup and hopefully I can get a few games and make some match winning contributions.\" All-rounder Kemp, 17, made her domestic bow earlier in the season, helping Southern Vipers win the Charlotte Edwards Cup. She then her England Women debut against South Africa in July before being part of the squad that reached the semi-finals at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Kemp has so far played nine T20 internationals and two one-day internationals, taking 11 wickets with her left-arm seam bowling and hitting a maiden international fifty in the second T20I against India.

Yorkshire's defeat at home to Gloucestershire in the last round of fixtures left them vulnerable to the drop and their demotion was confirmed when Warwickshire - inspired by a nine-wicket performance from seamer Liam Norwell - pulled off a remarkable final-day victory over Hampshire. Neither Root nor Malan played in that match, with Root's summer deemed over by the ECB - the former England captain instead playing golf at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland - and Malan out in Pakistan with England's T20 international squad. Yorkshire director of cricket Darren Gough revealed on a club website Q&A that Root has penned a new two-year deal at Headingley with Malan inking a two-year extension on top of the one year he had remaining on the contract he signed when he joined from Middlesex in November 2019.

England will return to Pakistan for three Tests later this year and Jacks believes his ability to bowl off-spin should help his case for selection.

The Nottinghamshire left-hander - who played all seven of the T20s in Pakistan - told Sky Sports he still has \"massive ambitions\" to play Test cricket having made the most recent of his four appearances in that format in India in 2016. Speaking to reporters in Pakistan last week, Duckett said: \"I'd love to be part of the Test squad. My game is very suited for that squad of players: Stokesy [captain Ben Stokes] and [coach Brendon] McCullum.\" England won six of their seven Tests this summer under the Stokes-McCullum partnership, with a new-found focus on positive, attacking cricket. Duckett added: \"It just seems they let you go and play with freedom.

The 33-year-old, who sustained the injury last month after slipping during a round of golf, will miss the T20 World Cup in Australia and his country's subsequent Test series in Pakistan. \"The actual injury was as such... a broken fibula in 3 places which required a plate, I dislocated my ankle which in turn meant I did my syndesmosis joint and lateral ligament along with a couple more bits,\" he posted on Instagram. \"All in all I have done a proper job on it! \"Anyway... on the positive side the operation went well and I am now three weeks post surgery and my staples have been removed. It's now all about swelling prevention and getting my ankle moving once again. These next few weeks/couple of months are the key to the recovery. \"As for a time scale on return to play I'm afraid it is too early to say, the first targets in mind are getting me back on my two feet again and making sure it's right. \"One thing is for sure and that is I shall not be partaking in anything more during 2022...however I cannot wait for what 2023 holds!!\" Speaking on Thursday after being named PCA Men's Player of the Year for his four hundreds in six Tests this summer, Bairstow said the break from cricket \"might be a good thing.\" He told Sky Sports News: \"There is a decent amount of recovery still to go but I am in some of the best hands you can be in. In some ways, the break might be a good thing. \"We have had a jam-packed last few years. It's been tricky at times living in bubbles, living away from home so much. I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and it's another testing point within my career. \"There have been many different tests along the way and I am excited for what this test is going to throw at me, to overcome that and come back even stronger in 2023.\" The injury was initially described as a \"freak accident\" but Bairstow elaborated further on the incident in an interview with The Telegraph. He told the newspaper that he was at the third hole at Pannal Golf Club in Yorkshire when he slipped down a steep slope, landing awkwardly. \"Normally when you slip you fall on your bum, which would have been fine as there's plenty of cushion in there. Except this time I tried to regain my balance, my left ankle turned right, dislocated and my weight went through my left lower leg. I heard it snap straight away. \"I took a couple of steps down, then slipped. By the time I crumpled into a heap, I was three-quarters of the way down. It's all a blur, it happened so quickly. \"I yelped. Uncontrollable screams, the sort you hear on a rugby field. The adrenaline kicked in, and I knew I needed an ambulance. We rang the head physio at England straight away and asked where I needed to go and what I needed to do. The next three hours without painkillers were not too fun.\" After he was taken to a hospital, Bairstow found out that he had fractures in his left fibula, which needed a five-inch plate and a dislocated ankle.

The BCCI medical team took the decision following a \"detailed assessment and in consultation with the specialists\". It is far from unexpected news, with the 28-year-old fast bowler having been sent for specialist consultations in Bengaluru following his withdrawal from the ongoing series against South Africa, but it is a decision the India camp was hoping to avoid. Bumrah's absence is another huge blow to India who also lost all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja to a knee injury that required surgery last month. Following Bumrah's withdrawal, the BCCI said it will name a replacement for the bowler in the squad for the tournament soon. Bumrah's place could go to Mohammed Shami, who was named as a reserve to the 15-man squad alongside fellow seamer Deepak Chahar, but Mohammed Siraj is also likely to come into the conversation after being called up as cover for the last two games against the Proteas.

Former England stars and now Sky Sports Cricket pundits Nasser Hussain and Mark Butcher have picked the sides they would go into battle with in Australia, with both selecting the in-form Harry Brook in their middle order. Brook, 23, finished as England's leading run-scorer in the 4-3 T20I series win in Pakistan, amassing 238 runs in six innings at an average of 79.33 and a strike rate of 163.01, with a best of 81 not from 35 balls in game three. The selection dilemmas for Nasser and Butch were if it will be Phil Salt or Alex Hales to partner skipper Jos Buttler at the top of the order and whether Chris Jordan or Chris Woakes complete the bowling line-up. Here's what they came up with... Jos Buttler (captain), Moeen Ali, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone, Dawid Malan, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Ben Stokes, Reece Topley, David Willey, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood. Travelling reserves: Liam Dawson, Richard Gleeson, Tymal Mills \"If you pick all your batters and have Moeen Ali or Liam Livingstone at No 7, you need your best bowlers irrespective of if they bat or not. \"For me, England's four best bowlers are Mark Wood - that's a given with his pace and X factor - Adil Rashid with his variations and ability at the death, Reece Topley with the way he has come on this year, has the left-arm angle and takes wickets up front, and then I'd go Jordan. \"You have to remember that in the last two T20 Worlds Cups, England have lost them through their death bowling. Ben Stokes in 2016 with Carlos Brathwaite's four sixes and Jordan in 2021 against New Zealand, so it is an area of concern. England need to sort it out. \"However, I feel Jordan this summer got it right, was getting back to his best. He has experience and has been a constant under Eoin Morgan and now Buttler's captaincy. I am not concerned about the new-ball bowling as Wood and Topley have done very well there. \"The other option is to leave a batter out - there are a lot of batters in there - and play Sam Curran. He is an exceptional all-round cricketer and gives you options bowling at the death. \"It's whether you go the Morgan template of the extra batter - some of the batters bowl in Stokes, Livingstone and Moeen - or you play the extra bowler because in Australia you feel that you need a safety blanket.

For me, for England to win this World Cup, Buttler has to have a very good tournament with the bat. \"When Morgan was leading, I thought his captaincy was more important than his batting and fielding. With Buttler, it is his batting, his batting, his batting and then his captaincy and wicketkeeping. \"Whatever makes Buttler tick with his batting is most important.

For me, he gets in the team. \"In terms of the openers, Salt is very much the coming man but England have picked Hales because of his record in Australia, the fact he has over 10,000 T20 runs and is arguably playing the cricket of his life. \"They want that big presence at the top of the order to intimidate opposition bowling attacks and I don't think anything has changed there, I don't see Hales on the bench.

He's back in England now, left this morning, and he'll be fine. He's just got to get some miles in the legs and he should be right to start when we get out there. \"I think Jos has been conservative.

With white-ball captain Jos Buttler taking a \"cautious\" approach in his comeback from a calf injury - he has yet to play at all in the series against Pakistan - Salt and Alex Hales have been the openers. The consensus seems to be that Salt and Hales are vying for one spot up top at the World Cup and that Hales' previous successes in the Big Bash League are likely to see him get the nod. Salt staked his claim for selection on Friday night, though, nailing 13 fours and three sixes in an unbeaten 87 from just 41 balls, giving England quite the selection headache ahead of the World Cup. \"I think the assumption [that Hales will open with Buttler] is right, given Hales' record in Australia and how relatively inexperienced Salt is in international cricket. But you don't ignore innings like that,\" said Sky Sports Cricket's Michael Atherton after watching Salt's spectacular innings. \"There is also an intriguing possibility with him also being a wicketkeeper. We saw in The Hundred [for Manchester Originals] that he kept wicket and Buttler captained from mid-off. \"Buttler has a lot on his plate as opener, captain and wicketkeeper, so England could take a responsibility off of him. You imagine Buttler will still keep wicket for now, but Salt could be an option down the line.\" Salt said: \"I'm not looking too far into the future. You need competition, the best sides have that. That's the same in every sport. Everyone's trying to put their best foot forward and show the coaches how good they are. \"I'm very grateful for the backing I've got from my team-mates and the management - it's very clear the way they want me to play. \"The way I play is aggressive and I want to win as many games as possible while I'm in an England shirt.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Salt managed only 19 runs combined in his previous three innings - out for eight, eight and three - but was at his blistering best on Friday. It took him just 19 balls to reach his second T20I fifty, while he and Hales (27 off 12) creamed 10 boundaries between them across the first three overs as they nailed a 50-run opening partnership in 18 balls. Atherton added: \"It was nice to see Salt go on and finish the game off unbeaten for his best innings in England colours. \"He is very strong down the ground and when the bowlers overpitch his driving is exceptional - it was a treat to behold. \"He is also quick onto the short ball. He has learnt from his errors [in previous games] and placed his pull shots better, and Pakistan had no answer to him. He treated the bowlers with an element of disdain.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Atherton's fellow Sky Sports pundit Mark Butcher said: \"Brutal, Salt beef, call it what you like. Some of the hitting was ferociously hard, flat sixes over square leg, the shots down the ground. He is able to generate alarming speed when the hands come through and he hits it as hard as anybody. \"He has really improved his off-side play in the last year or so. He was predominantly a leg-side player who looked to shovel everything into the leg-side, but he can now bang it over extra cover if bowlers go wide to him.\" Watch the series-deciding seventh T20 international between Pakistan and England live on Sky Sports Cricket on Sunday.

Following an in-depth process with close to 1,000 direct engagements, the report concluded that the governance and leadership practices of Cricket Scotland were institutionally racist. Independent investigators had found 448 indicators of institutional racism, while Cricket Scotland failed on 29 of 31 'tests' used to measure the problem and only partially met the required standard on the other two. Sixty-eight individual concerns were referred for further investigation, including 31 allegations of racism against 15 different people, two clubs and one regional association. The allegations included racial abuse, the use of inappropriate language, favouritism to young, white children from public schools and a lack of transparent selection process for non-white players. In some cases, multiple concerns have been raised against the same individual. The review followed complaints of institutional racism by Scotland cricket internationals Majid Haq and Qasim Sheikh. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Three immediate high-level recommendations were detailed in the report: Cricket Scotland is placed in special measures by sportscotland until at least October 2023, Cricket Scotland addresses the backlog in referrals generated from the review and Western District Cricket Union (WDCU) is placed in special measures by Cricket Scotland with immediate effect. Four or the several recommendations are yet to be completed: 1 - Board recruitment A target was set to appoint a new diverse board, after the previous one quit a day before the independent report was published. The board was required to consist of a minimum of 40 per cent men and 40 per cent women, and ensuring that a minimum of 25 per cent of the total board makeup came from of Black, South-East Asian, or other mixed or multiple ethnic groups. It is expected this will now be completed by October 21, three weeks later than planned, while Sky Sports News understands a new independent chair could be in place well before then. 2 - Action plan It was outlined Cricket Scotland must develop an action plan to address the immediate actions and short-term KPIs contained within the report. While this has not been met, it has been sent to Running out Racism and Sporting Equals for greater consultation prior to a final sign-off and will be published in the coming days. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  3 - Review into the Western District Cricket Union (WDCU) An urgent and independent review into the overall effectiveness of the Western District Cricket Union committee's implementation of the disciplinary processes was required. The union organises and promotes cricket to half the population of Scotland. This has not been met. However, a new executive committee is in place, with half of those in place from ethnically diverse communities, and that independent review of disciplinary process will be completed by October 30. 4 - Referrals Cricket Scotland were also required to address the backlog in referrals generated from the review. All 68 individual concerns that were referred for further investigation to organisations, including Police Scotland, are being independently looked at, with investigations underway where appropriate. This process is led by sports law firm Harper MacLeod LLP, UK-wide race equality charity Sporting Equals, with support from anti-racism campaign group Running Out Racism. Three areas that have been completed and remain ongoing include Cricket Scotland being placed in special measures by sportscotland - Scotland's national agency for sport. This will remain in place until October 2023. The WDCU are also in special measures while the union's role in managing all disciplinary matters relating to its competitions and clubs has also been suspended, with those powers being handed to an alternative organisation to manage. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Chief Operating Officer of sportscotland, Forbes Dunlop, said: \"In the eight weeks since publication of the Changing The Boundaries report, Cricket Scotland has made progress in several areas. However, it is important that further progress is achieved over the coming months to deliver the cultural change that we all want to see in Scottish cricket. \"The significance of the Cricket Scotland board appointments cannot be underestimated. The recruitment process for the independent chair and non-executive directors is ongoing and it is essential that Cricket Scotland appoints a diverse board that has the skillset to take the sport forward. That will be an important step in demonstrating real and meaningful change. \"It is unacceptable that anyone has experienced racist abuse and discrimination while playing cricket, and where that has been the case, steps must be taken to address the past. Referrals made as part of the review are now being reviewed and where appropriate investigated as part of a fully independent and robust process. \"Today's interim progress update and the associated Cricket Scotland short-term action plan must be followed up with robust actions and genuine cultural change within the sport. We will help Cricket Scotland to rebuild while keeping all options on the table to ensure they deliver on all recommendations in the Changing The Boundaries report.\" Interim chief executive of Cricket Scotland, Gordon Arthur, said: \"It has been a challenging two months for everyone at Cricket Scotland since Changing The Boundaries was published. A lot of good work has been done on the review process for referrals, the action plan, starting the long process to rebuild trust with our communities and to begin the change the culture that is needed in Cricket Scotland. \"This first of five quarterly reports demonstrates that much progress has been made, in addition to delivering 11 home international cricket matches, preparing the women's and men's international teams for World Cup qualifiers and the final weeks of the domestic season. \"We look forward to the appointment of a new board to help drive the work forward and are grateful for the ongoing support of sportscotland.\"", "england-star-dawid-malan-backs-proposed-changes-to-county-cricket-less-cricket-more-intensity": "Dawid Malan has publicly backed the proposals for changes to the county game, saying \"less cricket at a higher intensity\" would benefit players, allow them to commit to all forms and help England's Test side. The England and Wales Cricket Board's high-performance review, chaired by former England captain and director of cricket Sir Andrew Strauss, has suggested cutting the number of matches in the County Championship and Vitality Blast from 14 to 10. Those modifications, which include a streamlined red-ball top flight of six teams, could be implemented in time for the 2024 season if at least 12 of the 18 counties vote for them. \"Members raised questions and spoke with passion, with the overriding expression being one of opposition to the proposals which impact the domestic structure, including a reduction in the amount of cricket played across all formats. \"The discourse suggested emphasis should be placed on the schedule, rather than structure, while there is no compelling argument within the current proposals to suggest that change would necessarily be for the betterment of the game.\" Derbyshire have become the latest county to oppose the plans, with Lancashire previously expressing \"significant concerns\" over the proposals and Kent, Essex and Somerset releasing statements opposing the plans the day they were unveiled by the ECB. Speaking to reporters in Lahore ahead of England's sixth T20 international against Pakistan, Malan said: \"If you're a player that is trying to get better at your game, there's no time to work on your game and you're burning yourself out. \"With less cricket at a higher intensity and the ability to actually train and prepare for those games, I think your bowlers will be fitter. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"They will be able to bowl quicker for longer periods, it will be more challenging for batters and you can actually improve your game. \"We can't argue that the county system is working if we've only been number one in the world [in Test cricket] for X amount of time. \"We've produced some world-class cricketers but it's how the English system can produce cricketers that are going to be playing cricket similar to Test cricket. \"Testing them in all conditions, so that when they do make the step up, it's not like you're having to learn on the job. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"If you can create something that's going to encourage people to keep playing all formats of the game, that's going to be the winner for English cricket moving forward. \"It has to make it appealing for players to still want to play four-day cricket, scheduling-wise, so there is a bit of time between games for them to rest, recover and work on their games. \"You don't want to lose a lot of cricket but you don't want to get to the stage where people are saying 'it's too much, and I'd rather play XYZ'. \"Look at a young player like Will Jacks. \"I know he's got Test ambitions but if he starts doing really well and gets into the England white-ball stuff regularly and he's playing around the world in the winter in three or four tournaments, by the time it comes to April, then he is probably knackered after playing three or four [Championship] games. \"Something has to give for players like that.\" Malan has no plans to quit red-ball cricket for now and is eager to add to his 22 Test caps, the last of which came during the final Ashes Test in Hobart in January. However, at 35, the left-hander is realistic about his chances of a comeback in the longest form. Malan added: \"I'd still love to play Test cricket. Whether that's done or not, it's not up to me. I think it's pretty much done, but we'll find out and see how that works out. \"I still want to win trophies and have some goals that I want to achieve in terms of amount of runs and hundreds.\" Watch England's sixth T20 international in Pakistan live on Sky Sports Cricket on Friday.

The Bears needed to beat Hampshire to avoid becoming the first side since Middlesex in 2017 to drop out of the top flight a year after winning it. Warwickshire had Norwell to thank for their survival, with the seamer snaring a remarkable career-best 9-62 from 18.5 overs virtually unchanged as Hampshire were rolled for 133 in a chase of just 139 at Edgbaston. As a result, Yorkshire have slipped into the second tier alongside bottom side Gloucestershire, the team they lost to at Headingley on Wednesday. Norwell - who has endured an injury-ravaged campaign - was brilliant for the Bears, accounting for, among others, Hampshire skipper James Vince for 15, former Warwickshire player Keith Barker for four and top-scorer Nick Gubbins for 46. The former Gloucestershire paceman then bowled James Fuller (22) before pinning last man Mohammad Abbas (0) lbw in what proved the final over of the game to clinch a miraculous victory for his team and match figures of 13-100. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Oliver Hannon-Dalby (1-40) picked off Hampshire opener Felix Organ (5) to leave the visitors 6-1 before Norwell took over, starting when he bowled Ian Holland (3). Gubbins held firm at one end as Norwell collected wickets at the other, with Barker's dismissal half an hour into the final session - bowled off stump by a peach of a delivery - seeing Hampshire reduced to 91-7, still 48 runs shy of victory. Gubbins and Fuller appeared to have put Hampshire back on course for the win with an eighth-wicket stand of 33, but the former was trapped lbw with 15 runs required before the latter was castled with the visitors needing a further six. The game was over four balls later as Norwell pinned Abbas leg before to cap a staggering bowling display and keep his side in the Championship's top tier. The odds were heavily stacked against Warwickshire heading into day four, with the hosts 62-2 in their second innings and leading by just 23 runs. Dom Sibley - in his last game for the Bears before he returns to Surrey - turned his overnight 29 into 77 but received little support as Warwickshire were dismissed for 177, an innings in which Hampshire seamer Fuller bagged 4-34. Hampshire would have fancied clinching a 10th victory in 14 matches but ran into an inspired Norwell as they missed out on the chance to finish second in the table - and an additional £145,000 in prize money. Speaking afterwards, Norwell said: \"It was a mad day, really. It didn't really go to plan in the morning, we didn't get the runs we wanted, but when that happens you get your head down and bowl and see what happens. \"It just went my way. They played some average shots you might say but I got the ball in the right area enough. \"When Gubbins and Fuller were going well, we felt it was starting to slip away, but we kept going and somehow managed to pull it off. \"I don't know what I was thinking at the end. I just went mad. All the emotions came out and I was nearly in tears. \"It means a lot to me because I feel I've let the lads down being out injured so much this season. I hope helping us stay up has repaid them a little. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"I am so glad we are still in Division One next year. It means so much to the team and the club. It means everything. \"We want to win the County Championship. That's why we play four-day cricket.

Harmer's haul took him to a leading 59 wickets in Division One this season and shredded Northants after they had been set 211 for victory. Essex had begun the final day on 63-5 and were rolled for 110 as Jack White recorded figures of 6-38, but Northants then collapsed themselves as Harmer and seamer Sam Cook (3-43) starred. Northants finished sixth in the Championship - their highest finish in 27 years - with Essex ending up in fourth spot, behind winners Surrey, second-placed Lancashire and third-placed Hampshire.", "county-championship-middlesex-promoted-to-division-one-nottinghamshire-crowned-division-two-champions": "Middlesex clinched promotion back to Division One of the LV= Insurance County Championship after a final-day washout against Worcestershire earned the visitors the draw they needed. The Lord's side had effectively guaranteed a return to the top flight after picking up maximum batting points on the third day at New Road as they carded 509 all out. Middlesex gained a further eight points for the draw to ensure they finished above Glamorgan in the second promotion spot and joined champions Nottinghamshire in going up. Nottinghamshire wrapped up promotion on Wednesday via bonus points and were confirmed as division winners a day later as they completed a 462-run thrashing of Durham at Trent Bridge, their eighth victory in 14 games this term. Durham were torpedoed for just 114 after resuming on 14-2 with Nottinghamshire taking the seven wickets they required in just over two hours - Durham batter David Bedingham unable to bat due to a dislocated shoulder. England seamer Stuart Broad finished with figures of 3-36 in his first appearance for Notts since May, while left-arm spinner Liam Patterson White (3-41) and paceman Dane Paterson (2-27) were also in the wickets. Durham's day was made even worse by a 10-point deduction imposed on them after Australian batter Nic Maddinson's bat failed a size test during the game with Derbyshire earlier this month. The Cricket Discipline Commission considered that there was no intent by Maddinson to gain an unfair advantage but said the onus was on players to make sure the equipment they use conforms to the laws of the game. Nottinghamshire are back in Division One for the first time since 2019 with Middlesex returning to the top flight following their relegation at the end of the 2017 campaign. Notts captain Steven Mullaney said: \"I'm relieved, emotional, very proud. I'm very proud of everyone, and immensely proud to be lifting that trophy. \"After the adversity we went through in not winning a red ball game for almost three years up to last year, and then the disappointment of starting this year in Division Two after finishing third in last year's format, it feels all worthwhile at the minute. \"Whenever we've needed someone to stand up, someone has. It has been a great team effort, from the players to the backroom staff, and we look forward to playing in Division One next season. \"I think it epitomises the club when Stuart Broad has got some time off, he's booked some time away with his fiancee, who is heavily pregnant, but he wanted to play in this game. \"It wasn't a question of asking him - he texted me and said he wanted to play. Obviously we are very thankful to him for that.\" Elsewhere in Division Two, seventh-placed Sussex piled on 554-8 during their draw with Glamorgan at Hove as Ali Orr made 198, Tom Haines 177 and 18-year-old Dan Ebrahim an unbeaten 100. Orr missed out on a maiden double ton in cruel fashion, as he was run out backing up with a drive from Haines deflecting off bowler Ajaz Patel's fingers and onto the non-striker's stumps. Haines' century was his second of the match after a first-innings 108 not out, while teenager Ibrahim's was the first of his first-class career. For Glamorgan, off-spinner Andrew Salter took 5-138 while retiring seamer Michael Hogan, 41, was given a guard of honour and a standing ovation in his last game for the club. At the other end of the age spectrum, Leicestershire all-rounder Rehan Ahmed, 18, scored a superb maiden century to save the Foxes from defeat at Derbyshire. Ahmed struck a sublime 122 off 113 balls to provide a memorable finale to a miserable season for Division Two's bottom club, becoming the first Foxes player to score his first hundred and bag his maiden five-wicket haul in the same match. Leicestershire were 86 runs ahead at 405-7 when rain consigned the game to a draw with 20 overs remaining - Derbyshire ending the campaign in fifth spot.", "george-garton-sussex-bowler-explains-road-to-recovery-from-health-issues-and-2023-ambitions": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It tells you something about how challenging life has been for George Garton over the past few months that when the diagnosis of a lung clot came he felt an overriding sense of relief. Physically and emotionally he has been very nearly broken by what he thought was long Covid, at one point Garton believed retirement might be his only way out, but after numerous tests, scans, supplements, breathing lessons and agonising false starts, his grandmother referred him to an old contact where she used to work at his local hospital in Sussex to see Professor Rob Galloway. \"It's been a big mental shift to finally be told what actually might be wrong,\" Garton said. \"To have a reason for feeling fatigued and having high heart rates. It is like a weight being lifted off my shoulders rather than just having a blanket term of long Covid. \"There feels an end to this. Knowing lots of people have had blood clots and there's science behind the recovery and to have an end goal is really nice.\" It's taken an awful lot for Garton to get here. The Sussex bowler suffered his first bout of Covid last year on the eve of making his ODI England debut against Pakistan. He felt rough for three or four days but recovered quickly and played the rest of the season before heading out to the Big Bash. He caught Covid on the plane home, having left Australia early to prepare for England's T20 Tour of the West Indies. After his isolation period, Garton was cleared to travel and felt good to go. \"I felt fine, played, trained, made my debut and had an absolute blast, it was a great time and I came home and went on holiday with my Dad for a week in America,\" Garton said. \"I came back from that and thought I would knuckle down with Sussex to train and almost instantly I felt something was not quite right. I put it down to playing all winter, not being fully fit. So I thought, right, go get the fitness up, do more running but it wasn't a fatigue or a tiredness that I could push through. \"Usually as an athlete, you're well aware of your body and how you can push through tiredness, but this was like running into a brick wall. Towards the end of the second week, after I bowled one over, my body started kind of shaking quite aggressively. I felt like I was going to pass out. So I just stopped and I said, 'look, something's really not right.'\" All of Garton's tests came back clear, but given his recent medical history, the specialists believed Garton was suffering with long Covid, something at that point he'd never heard of. \"I thought it's just fatigue and I'm going to get over it really quickly,\" he said. \"I didn't really pay much attention to it being an actual injury. I just thought it's something that my body will recover with I'm fit and healthy.\" At his worst, Garton couldn't go and make a cup of coffee without having to lie down afterwards with severe exhaustion. After the short walk from his flat to the County Ground he said it was \"scary\" how out of breath and puffing he would be for half an hour after. \"The specialists were saying 'we reckon you'll be okay, we're 99 per cent sure,'\" Garton said. \"I kept thinking what about the one per cent? No one knows too much about it. I seem to be an anomaly when it comes to how long it's taken to recover. \"So why can't I be that one per cent? I was trying so hard and then I kept being knocked back down and that cycle carried on where I would rest for a bit, do a bit of training and feel like I was fit and healthy again, go to do my job and then kind of crash back down to earth.\" It was during his first game back when Garton feared he couldn't carry on with cricket. \"I thought would be able to keep everything under control,\" he said. \"I was playing a four-day game against Middlesex at Hove and on the first day I batted from tea time until the end. After about an hour I felt all the symptoms again, so tired. I needed some caffeine to keep myself awake and that made my heart rate rise. \"I remember coming home that day after even when I was about to go to bed it was about 100, four hours after I'd done just a little bit of batting. I thought this can't carry on. I thought I can't mentally put myself through it. I tried to play at 70 per cent and manage myself and it just wasn't working. I couldn't perform to the level I wanted to and I expected of myself and that was harder mentally than it was physically.\" A session with Sussex's psychologist made him realise the role his mind might be able to play in his recovery and understanding that whatever was happening to his body needed to be seen as a real injury and it would eventually heal. As frustrating as it was, he had to believe it would happen and Garton had to shake off the stigma he admitted to feeling about being \"tired\". Garton went back to the specialists, explored every option he had.

I thought 'I'm over this'. I played a couple second-team games for Sussex and did well and I had trust in my body again,\" said Garton, who admitted: \"I was just happy to be there, to be playing and enjoying doing the job again.\" It was not long before Garton was making headlines. His stunning bowling display for the Southern Brave against the Welsh Fire when he took three wickets in the first seven balls was impressive, but so too was the honesty he had spoken with during the competition as he opened up on his health battles. Garton really believed and hoped he left the debilitating symptoms behind. \"I got out of that match and I just didn't feel right again and I had to go off,\" he said. \"My breathing was high. My heart rate was higher. It was almost like a panic attack. I had that feeling that I was in a downward spiral. \"I'm worrying about my fatigue, so I'm breathing heavier and then my mind's thinking about the breathing and the panic and so I have to go off. Unfortunately the symptoms of high heart rate and fatigue came back again for a couple of weeks. Touch wood, though, I seem to be over it again now. I feel confident in my body, especially after the diagnosis of the passed blood clot. It's about strengthening my mind and body, knowing it can cope.\" Garton won't allow himself to dwell on what might have been this year, instead he is looking forward to 2023. He is taking his recovery gently, giving himself the time and space he needs and what is crucial, he says, is having a target - a place in the new South African T20 league is in his sights. Garton said: \"Times like this shape you, it's what pushes and it gives you the really fun times and those fun times are a lot more enjoyable because of what you have gone through\".

England, chasing 170, needed just 17 runs to win after Dean (47) and Freya Davies (10no) produced a valiant last-wicket partnership of 35 that was brought to an end when Deepti Sharma (1-24) ran out non-striker Dean. The dismissal - named after India bowler Vinoo Mankad, who ran out Australia's Bill Brown in 1947 - is seen by many as against the spirit of the game but, as Sharma was in her delivery stride when she turned to take off the bails as Dean walked down the crease, it was a legal move.

A fourth wicket in the powerplay came via Davies - the one change from either side - as she dismissed Harleen Deol (3), with England captain Jones successfully reviewing despite Davies' lack of interest. England took their foot off the gas somewhat when removing the seamers from the attack, and Mandhana and Sharma put on 58 before Cross' return brought a crucial wicket in the most bizarre circumstances. Mandhana tried to pull a short and wide one but toe-ended it onto her own stumps. Dayalan Hemalatha (2) was then dismissed by Sophie Ecclestone - thanks to a superb diving catch from Dean - before Pooja Vastrakar's quickfire 22 was ended with an lbw to another off-spinner in Dean.

But Sharma continued to impress and, with India all out with 26 balls still remaining, it looked like England's game to lose. England got off to a steady start with Tammy Beaumont and Emma Lamb putting on 27 for the first wicket, but their innings started to crumble after Lamb (21) was superbly stumped by Yastika after dancing down the track to Thakur. Thakur was the most dangerous of the Indian bowlers and she bowled Beamont (8) with a beauty that angled in, and Sophia Dunkley (7) with one that nipped away.

Before the match, Goswami said: \"Each and every moment [of 20-year career] has had a lot of emotions, a lot of effort put in. \"But the 2017 World Cup where our team came back and fought [is the highlight]. \"Nobody gave us a chance initially that we would be playing in a final, but the way we played that tournament was something different I think, and from there, women's cricket in India slowly and gradually picked up. \"And at this moment, we have our own path to motivate generations and young girls to take up sport and that they have an option with cricket.\" As she came out to bat in the first innings, the England players gave Goswami a guard of honour, while her team-mates did the same when they took the field. Former India captain Mithali Raj described her retirement as the \"end of an era\", while England's Tammy Beaumont said \"she'll be a very big loss\". Others from around cricket also paid tribute to Goswami, with Virat Kohli tweeting that she has been a \"great servant of Indian cricket\" and Harbhajan Singh describing her as his \"favourite bowler\". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For many Indians Goswami is the last link between two eras of women's cricket in the country. The first era saw the emergence of Goswami, alongside Mithali Raj, Diana Edulji, Shikha Pandey and Shantha Rangaswamy and laid the path for the current crop. Along with Pandey, Goswami was, and still is, the flag bearer for India's seam bowling, an area which has lacked depth until recently. Goswami's retirement comes soon after Raj stopped playing international cricket. During her time with the international side, India have gone from a middling team to one of the world's best, with an ever-increasing following and the possibility for more talent to emerge through the Women's IPL. Her career remains a blueprint for the talent hidden in small Indian villages. Current India men's captain Rohit Sharma recently described Goswami as a once-in-a-generation player, and the likes of Renuka Thakur and Meghna Singh will hope now to build the legacy she leaves.", "harry-brook-england-batter-must-be-in-t20-world-cup-xi-says-nasser-hussain": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Harry Brook's brilliant performances against Pakistan mean he is \"nailed on\" to play England's opening game at the T20 World Cup, according to Nasser Hussain.

The hosts stretched their second-innings total from 277-1 to 337-4 declared, captain Tom Abell bringing up his second century of the match before falling for 115 and Tom Lammonby contributing 110. It set an intimidating victory target of 462 for Northamptonshire and they got off to a dreadful start with four wickets falling for 15. Craig Overton, who finished with match figures of 7-74, ran out Emilio Gay to start the fifth over before pinning Luke Procter lbw three balls later. The visitors woes continued after lunch, with only Tom Taylor able to go beyond the 20-run mark, posting 25 before being dismissed lbw by Josh Davey, who finished with 3-25. It was all wrapped up after 30.4 overs when Overton caught Jack White at second slip, Northamptonshire all out for 109. In Division Two, Middlesex clinched a crucial 80-run victory over Leicestershire at the Uptonsteel County Ground to keep their promotion hopes alive. Having reduced Leicestershire to 13-4 by Thursday's close, in pursuit of 275, Middlesex looked set to wrap up victory relatively easily on Friday as the hosts slumped to 70-7, but Colin Ackermann - who batted for almost four hours for his 80 - and the Leicestershire tail refused to fold. They had progressed to 194 before Middlesex, for whom Toby Roland-Jones finished with 4-34 and seven wickets in the match, were able to close out the win. The victory moved them to 209 points, just nine shy of division leaders Nottinghamshire after the penultimate round of games. Glamorgan ensured they remained in the promotion picture too with an innings-and-24-run victory over Derbyshire. Seamer James Harris made the crucial breakthroughs with the wickets of Anuj Dal and Wayne Madsen, who top-scored in Derbyshire's second innings with 77, on his way to figures of 3-59. Australian Michael Hogan marked his last appearance in Cardiff after a decade with Glamorgan with 2-54 as the visitors were dismissed for 273. Durham won by an innings and 140 runs as some brave Sussex resistance came to an end after lunch on the final day at Chester-le-Street. Sussex had been rescued by the rain on Thursday, but the weather was not on their side as they attempted to avoid defeat on the final day. Tom Haines and James Coles, resuming with Sussex 9-4, put on a 50 partnership in quick time as the visitors took a positive approach to playing Durham's attack in good batting conditions.

England and India will play the final ODI of the series at the Home of Cricket on Saturday, with India looking for a series whitewash. The last time England played at Lord's was in 2017, for the historic World Cup final, when they beat India to lift the trophy in front of a sell-out crowd. \"I think it's far too long,\" the England opener said. \"I believe I am the only one who played in that game playing tomorrow.

Lisa Keightley will step down after Saturday's ODI against India. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced in August that she will not extend her contract and the ODI series against India would be her last. Keightley led England to the semi-final of the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup, as well as the final of the 2022 ICC Women's World Cup. Despite her contract ending in December, she said after the second ODI that she will leave early to give enough time for the next coach to put their mark on the side before the World Cup in 2023. Former England captain Charlotte Edwards was among the favourites to replace Keightley, but she distanced herself from the role during England's T20 series-clinching win over India on September 15. That means there are no clear candidates for the role, with a number of coaches touted to take the role. A member of England's coaching staff, the former West Indies international has been in the England women's set-up since joining in 2018. He is currently a performance coach for spin and took his first head coach role in August, taking charge of the Welsh Fire, working closely with the likes of England internationals Tammy Beaumont and Katie George. Taking over from Matthew Mott, who took charge of England men's white-ball teams, the Welsh Fire women's team only won one game under Breese during the 2022 edition of The Hundred. Breese's inexperience as a head coach would make him a left-field appointment. The Former England international has developed into a highly respected coach since retiring. She guided the Northern Diamonds to consecutive Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy finals and to the runners-up spot in the first Charlotte Edwards Cup. She took the position at the Diamonds in 2020, a year after she retired, and after a spell in charge of the Yorkshire Diamonds in the final season of the Kia Super League. During the first season of The Hundred, Hazell added to her coaching experience after taking charge of the Northern Superchargers. The England head coach role might be too soon for the 34-year-old, though. Former Yorkshire player Salliann Beams has built a reputation as an impressive coach away from the UK, primarily taking coaching roles in Australia. She guided the Tasmanian Tigers to silverware after four seasons in charge of the Hobart Hurricanes in the WBBL. Beams previously held coaching roles with the ECB and was appointed as Cricket Tasmania's new general manager of high performance in August 2022. Along with her responsibilities in Australia, she recently took charge of the Trent Rockets for a second year in The Hundred, losing in the Eliminator to the Southern Brave by two runs. Before Keightley took over, Beams was in contention to take over from Mark Robinson. Former Surrey wicketkeeper Jonathan Batty has led the Oval Invincibles to back-to-back titles in The Hundred, which has seen Alice Capsey break through to the England side. He is also the head coach of the Surrey women's team and was previously in charge of the South East Stars during the first year of the regional structure introduced to the English women's domestic cricket in 2020. Ahead of the winter WBBL, Batty was appointed as the head coach of the Melbourne Stars. Former Durham captain Jonathan Lewis is an experienced coach, having taken various roles since retiring. He coached Durham's men's team to the County Championship title almost 10 years ago and has taken several coaching roles in his career after retiring. Lewis has worked as a batting consultant in England squads, and did similar roles with the men's teams of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. He was also a batting coach for the England men's ODI team and assistant coach for the England women's side in 2020. Since last year, he has been a batting consultant with the ECB for the women's side. While he has no head-coaching experience in the women's game, Lewis is a well-respected coach and his career so far shares parallels with Mark Robinson, who was successful with Sussex before taking over the England reins. Another left-field choice, former Australian international Julia Price recently stepped down as the head coach of the United States women's team. The US team were granted full Women's T20 International status by the ICC in 2018 and Price stepped into the role a year later, while also becoming the first female coach in the Big Bash when she was appointed as Darren Lehmann's assistant at Brisbane Heat.", "ecb-recruits-thousands-of-south-asian-women-volunteers-as-part-of-action-plan": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  More than 2,000 women from South Asian backgrounds have been recruited and trained for volunteering roles in an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)\ninitiative.

And sometimes, cricket lives for highlight-reel brawn at the crease. Ever wondered which players strike the ball the hardest? Sky Sports partnered with Audi this summer to answer that question with the introduction of the Power Meter for the second season of The Hundred. It set the tone for Sky and Audi's ambition to implement further innovation across multiple sports within the channel's offering, from golf to rugby league and beyond. \"Audi and Sky are two partners that have innovation at the heart of what they do,\" said Tony Moore, Audi's Head of Marketing. \"Vorsprung durch Technik is more than a strapline, we live progress in all we do. \"It's a real innovation for cricket and a real first for the sport, it features in both the men's and women's game.

It's such an exciting start for us to be doing this with the Power Meter.\" The Power Meter utilises Hawkeye data to measure the biggest shots in both the men and women's competition, pitting the Liam Livingstones and Will Jacks of the world against one another while highlighting the talents of the Lizelle Lees and Nat Scivers. \"We get asked a lot, who hits the ball the hardest? It's a very difficult thing to quantify, it's speed off the bat, launch angle, because if you hit it 90 degrees straight up that's not what you want from the game of cricket, you want it about 45 degrees, and also distance,\" said former England captain Nasser Hussain. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Power Meter saw five additional Hawkeye cameras spread around grounds in order to accurately track the path of the ball from the bat to its end point. Hawkeye data rated both the speed and distance of shots out of 50 before producing a combined score out of 100, with data bars visible on screen to animate each value. \"They measure speed off the bat, launch angles, and then they come up with a rating,\" said Bryan Henderson, Director of Cricket for Sky Sports. \"If Liam Livingstone for example hits a six 120m, smashes it out the park, then that's going to get a rating of about 96, something like that. At the heart of The Hundred's introduction and early success has been its gender-inclusive appeal to young and new audiences in addition to long-time cricket fans. This season saw families make up 41 per cent of ticket sales in a rise from 36 per cent in 2021, while 271,000 people attended the women's tournament in a global record for a women's cricket competition, the ECB announced.

Pakistan captain Babar struck 110 from 66 balls, with opening partner Rizwan finishing on 88 from 51 deliveries as the hosts chased down a target of 200 with three balls to spare in Karachi. England appeared to be in a hugely strong position after captain Moeen Ali's unbeaten 55 helped his side post 199-5 having won the toss and chosen to bat, on a surface that both skippers had said they expected to favour the bowlers. The partnership between Babar and Rizwan was the highest in any chasing effort in men's T20 internationals, extending their previous record of 197 against South Africa in 2021. A seventh century stand between the pair also saw them extend their record for the most between any two batters in T20Is. The stand also saw Pakistan set a new record for the highest chase in all men's T20s without losing a wicket, while Babar's century, which included11 fours and five maximums, made him the first Pakistani batter to score two T20I centuries. Pakistan's remarkable batting display ensured the home side levelled the seven-match series, with the teams set to meet again just 24 hours later for their third encounter at the same ground on Friday. Moeen won the toss for a second successive game but changed tack from Tuesday's victory as he decided to bat first, with England making one change as spinner Liam Dawson came in for seamer Richard Gleeson. The decision at the toss initially appeared to be a good one as Alex Hales, who made a half-century on Tuesday in his return to international cricket after a three-year exile, once more helped get England off to a fast start.

Ben Duckett denied Dahani a hat-trick, and then set about a hugely-impressive innings that saw him sweep and reverse sweep Pakistan's spinners to great effect as he made 43 from just 22 balls.

Once more one brought two for Pakistan as Duckett was bowled by Mohammad Nawaz in the following over, leaving England with two new batters at the crease in Harry Brook and Moeen with the score at 101-4 in the 13th over. Brook, who had impressed with a cameo to get England over the line in the first game, picked up where he left off. The Yorkshire batter struck three sixes, including a delightful drive over extra cover, on his way to making 31 from 19 balls. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Moeen had already made his intentions clear by hitting successive sixes off Usman Qadir into the leg side, but once Brook went the skipper went up another gear. Dahani was denied the scalp of Ali's wicket as Khushdil Shah made an inexcusable drop at deep mid-wicket, when Ali miscued the ball on 32. He made Pakistan pay, smashing the final two deliveries of the innings for sixes to reach 55 from just 23 balls - the seventh fastest T20I half-century by an England batter - and helping England set a total that most assumed the hosts would have little chance of chasing. However, that notion was quickly dismissed as Rizwan struck David Willey for two boundaries in the opening over to get Pakistan off to a strong start. Dawson went for just four runs as he opened from the other end, as the spinner's final figures of 0-26 left him, along with Sam Curran (0-29), as the England bowlers not to suffer extreme punishment from Pakistan. Perhaps the most crucial moment of the match came when Dawson returned to bowl the sixth over, as Rizwan, on 23 at the time, miscued an attempt at a big shot high into the air, only for Hales to drop it at mid-off. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Pakistan batter would add insult to injury by hitting Dawson's next ball for six over long-on, and neither he nor Babar offered England a chance after that moment. However, the large nature of England's total meant that even when Pakistan reached 87 without loss at the halfway stage, there was plenty of doubt as to whether they'd convert the promising position into victory. The hosts had been 87-1 at the same stage in Tuesday's opener, before going on to make just 158 from their 20 overs. That effort had let to discussion ahead of Thursday's clash about the state of the Pakistan's middle-order, with Azam even adding at the toss that improvement was required. Ultimately, they weren't needed. The 13th over, which was Moeen's first, proved crucial, as Babar struck two sixes, before Rizwan added another, to give Pakistan 21 runs from it.

The review, which has been led by the former England captain and endorsed by the ECB, includes 17 recommendations in total for men's cricket and Strauss says they can help England be the \"world's best team across all formats within five years, for a sustained period of time\". The most eye-catching proposals regard a domestic reform. It suggests a six-team top County Championship division, with two conferences below that also of six teams vying for one promotion place. There is also a drop in matches, from 14 to 10, while the schedule is set for May-September to allow more cricket in the best conditions. There are plans for the One-Day Cup to be played entirely in April, with six rounds and a significant knock-out element, while the T20 Blast would be from May to July with a focus on Thursday-to-Sunday \"prime slots\". Speaking after the announcement on Sky Sports News, Atherton said that there will always be \"an element of compromise\" with reviews but the proposed changes to the County game will not please certain teams. He said: \"It is a more coherent schedule than what we have now, but there will be some counties who will bulk at it. Clubs like Kent, Essex, Somerset - those are the clubs that will be fearing for their future. \"A reduction in county championship games to 10 - the members will have an issue with that, and of course the vast majority of clubs are member-owner organisations. \"They'll have to consult with their members.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  As part of the review, Strauss and his team would have had to consider two polarising views, according to Atherton. He noted that the needs to County cricket are different to what is required from The Hundred. \"It is fiendishly difficult,\" he said. \"It is a better compromise than what we have now, if it gets through. 15 of them will get passed through, and they are all fairly obvious things to promote. \"The two contentious things are the future schedule of the domestic game, and that is where it will get sticky. \"They are trying to find a balance for players, clubs and supporters.

Kent's chair, Simon Philip, said his country are a \"fundamental part of our community\", adding that \"we will not allow our club to be rendered irrelevant\" and the review has been \"prepared through the prism of High Performance only\". \"We continue to deliver success on the field, produce players for England and support one of the largest recreational and schools cricket populations in the country,\" he added.

Surrey's victory on day three at The Oval clinched the county's second title in five years - and 21st overall - as rivals Hampshire, who needed a win to stay in the Championship race, lost by 77 runs to Kent. Needing just 55 runs to win in the second innings, openers Rory Burns and Ryan Patel secured the title for Surrey in just six overs. Earlier on day three, Surrey had bowled out Yorkshire for 208 runs, after they enforced the follow-on. Starting the day on 89-2, Yorkshire lost four wickets before lunch and could only make 58 runs after lunch. Daniel Worrall was the pick of the bowlers for Surrey, finishing with figures of 4-61, while Kemar Roach and Jamie Overton both took two wickets a piece. Adam Lyth and Dom Bess were out in their 40s, but Surrey were superior throughout the Test match. England's Pope was in the runs again, scoring 136 in the first innings to help Surrey set a good score of 333. Surrey were in a precarious position when he came to the crease with the score at 82-3 and by the time Jordan Clarke entered the fray, Surrey were 136-6. But a seventh-wicket partnership between Pope and Clarke, who was bowled on 55, took Surrey to near 300. Chasing 333, Surrey bowlers were relentless and had taken four wickets within 30 overs. A half-century by Tom Kohler-Cadmore and 45 not out by captain Jonathan Tattersall were not enough, as Yorkshire were all out for 179. Thomas Lawes finished with 4-31, as Surrey captain Burns enforced the follow-on. It was a similar story in the second innings for Yorkshire, who could only set Surrey 55 runs to win. Knowing a win would be enough to secure the title, Burns and Patel made easy work of the total. Hampshire's title hopes were ended by Kent, who ran out winners by 77 runs inside three days at the Ageas Bowl. Victory boosted Kent's Division One survival hopes and condemned Gloucestershire to relegation. James Fuller hit 78 not out and James Vince 73 for Hampshire, but they were bowled out for 300. Hampshire had won five of their previous six home matches, the other a rain-hit draw against Lancashire in April. Tom Price produced an inspired career-best performance of eight for 23 and match figures of 10 for 73 to ease Gloucestershire to a three-wicket triumph over Warwickshire at Bristol. Gloucestershire banked 21 points, but their first victory in 13 attempts in red-ball cricket this summer has come too late to save them from relegation. As for Warwickshire, they remain second from bottom in the table and, with one game to play, look like joining Gloucestershire in Division Two next year. Somerset will go into the final day of their match with Northamptonshire at Taunton in a strong position, knowing victory will guarantee Division One survival. With a lead of 401 and nine second-innings wickets still in hand, the home side can feel confident of at least a draw, which would put them 17 points clear of second-from-bottom Warwickshire. Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire suffered only their second defeat of the season after losing by an innings and 79 runs to Worcestershire at New Road. The home side collected the four remaining Nottinghamshire second-innings wickets inside 70 minutes as they were dismissed for 183 in 52.2 overs. Middlesex are within sight of a victory that will put them squarely in contention for the title after Leicestershire's fragile batting undid their good work with the ball. Skipper Callum Parkinson took four for 69 and young leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed a career-best three for 50 as Middlesex collapsed from 209 for three to 271 all out in their second innings, losing their last seven wickets for 62 after Mark Stoneman (81) and Max Holden (91) had put on 165 for the fourth wicket. It left Leicestershire with a fourth-innings target of 275 to record their first win of the season. Instead they are in deep trouble at 13 for four going into the final day. New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel claimed his first five-wicket haul for Glamorgan to help them close in on victory at home to Derbyshire. The Welsh county need another seven wickets on the final day to maintain the pressure on Middlesex in the race for the second promotion spot.

The review, which has been led by the former England captain and endorsed by the ECB, includes 17 recommendations in total for men's cricket and Strauss says they can help England be the \"world's best team across all formats within five years, for a sustained period of time\". The most eye-catching proposals regard a domestic reform. The report recommends a six-team top County Championship division, with two conferences below that also of six teams vying for one promotion place. There is also a drop in matches, from 14 to 10, while the schedule is set for May to September to allow more cricket in the best conditions. There are plans for the One-Day Cup to be played entirely in April, with six rounds and a significant knock-out element, while the T20 Blast would be from May to July with a focus on Thursday-to-Sunday \"prime slots\". The Hundred is set to remain in August.

It's one big Rubix cube and I think this is the best solution for English cricket moving forward. \"It answers some of the fundamental issues that have prevented England achieving [sustained success] in the past.\" Strauss, also previously ECB director of cricket, said a six-team top division would lead to a \"higher standard\". \"It means the quality of player is going to be higher, the quality of cricket is going to be higher,\" he explained. \"It reduces the gap between domestic cricket and international cricket. And there's slightly less cricket, so more time for rest and repair.\" Asked if he was confident the FCCs would approve, he said: \"I hope so. These are a package of recommendations where if they work together, they complement each other brilliantly.\" Strauss' panel of experts for the review, established following last winter's Ashes defeat in Australia, includes Sir Dave Brailsford, Dan Ashworth and current managing director of England men's cricket Rob Key, and the report published on Thursday aims for a \"thriving domestic game\" and for \"England teams that inspire by the way they win.\" The review highlights England's lack of success overseas compared to at home in international cricket, and recommends the pilot use of the Kookaburra ball in domestic first-class cricket to help players. There is also a proposal for an overseas pre-season 'North vs South' competition, and improved access to overseas warm weather training facilities. It is within the ECB's remit to implement 15 of the 17 recommendations, with the other two relating to the aforementioned domestic structure. \"I am delighted that we are today able to publish the report, which sets out the fundamental changes that we believe are needed to achieve sustained success for our England Men's team and to enable the men's domestic game to evolve in the face of a rapidly-changing environment for cricket globally,\" said Strauss. \"The game must be united if we are to achieve those ambitions and we must be open-minded to change. The most consistent message we have received, from players to fans and coaches, was that the status quo is not an option. \"I encourage people to consider our proposals as a package, and I welcome the opportunity for informed debate on the recommended changes to the men's domestic structure. \"There are no easy answers on the men's domestic structure. The recommendations have prioritised a more coherent schedule which is more manageable for overworked players, coaches and groundstaff while providing the quality and quantity of cricket that fans want to watch and which meets our high-performance objectives. \"That includes playing first-class cricket in each month from May until September, increasing the standard and intensity of the LV= Insurance County Championship and ensuring more opportunities for the best players to play across all domestic competitions.\"", "england-vs-india-harmanpreet-kaurs-unbeaten-century-sets-up-odi-series-clinching-win-for-tourists": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  India sealed a one-day international series win over England as captain Harmanpreet Kaur's brilliant unbeaten century set up an 88-run victory at Canterbury.  Kaur's stunning 143 not out helped her side post 333-5 after being put in to bat, before England were all out for 245 to give India an unassailable 2-0 lead ahead of Saturday's series finale at Lord's. The defeat hands England a first standalone home ODI series defeat since 2007 and is India's first 50-over series win in England since 1999. The India captain paced her innings perfectly, steadily accelerating to reach 100 runs from as many balls, before smashing 43 from 11 deliveries to put the tourists in a commanding position. Kaur was supported by opener Smriti Mandhana (40) and a first ODI half-century from Harleen Doel, as England's bowlers took some extreme punishment as they conceded their highest ever total in a home ODI. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Lauren Bell briefly set the record for the most expensive figures by an England bowler in an ODI as she finished with 1-79, before debutant Freya Kemp, who went for 26 runs from an 11-ball over, ended with 1-82. England came out with a positive batting mindset as they attempted what would have been a record chase, but the loss of three early wickets, two of which were claimed by Renuka Singh Thakur (4-57), made an already challenging task near impossible. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Alice Capsey, who had missed the final 20 overs of India's innings after suffering a finger injury, struck a spirited 39, before Danni Wyatt (65) and captain Amy Jones (39) put up England's final defence. Wyatt's dismissal triggered the loss of four wickets for just 16 runs before India eventually sealed a victory that leaves the tourists heading to Lord's on Saturday free to enjoy the first women's international at the ground since 2017. England's stand-in captain Jones made headlines at the toss, not because of her very reasonable decision to bowl in unpredictable conditions, but with the team news she shared. While it was no surprise that England made changes to the side that was defeated in Sunday's series opener, the omission of Alice Davidson-Richards, who had top scored with an unbeaten 50, seemed a strange choice. The 17-year-old Kemp came in for her debut, while England's quickest bowling option Issy Wong was replaced by Bell, 21, who made just her third ODI appearance. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  England's selection appeared to be justified early on as Kate Cross, playing in her 50th ODI, struck in the second over to remove Shafali Verma for 8. India continued to play positively but the introduction of England's spinners, Charlie Dean (1-39) and Sophie Ecclestone (1-64), saw the home side come back into the game. Dean removed the dangerous Yastika Bhatia for 26 with a caught and bowled, before Ecclestone trapped Mandhana lbw for 40 to leave India at 99-3 in the 20th over. A period of control followed for England as India added just 24 from the following seven overs, but the re-introduction of seamers would see the momentum change. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Kaur, who had guided India to victory with an unbeaten 74 in the first game of the series, went on the attack, producing a truly memorable display of ball-striking. The captain was ably supported by Deol, but when she was out 58, Kaur went into another gear, with nothing England tried remotely slowing her down. Pooja Vastrakar (18) and Deepti Sharma (15 not out) largely stood and watched from the non-striker's end as England's bowlers were left open-mouthed by Kaur, who ended with 18 fours and four sixes. England had to approach the chase of what would have been a record ODI target with positivity, but that approach quickly backfired as Tammy Beaumont (6) was run out in the second over. As if her batting display hadn't been enough, it was Kaur who inflicted the run-out with a direct hit as Beaumont attempted a quick single. Thakur then bowled Sophia Dunkley (1) two overs later, before getting Emma Lamb (15) lbw to reduce England to 47-3. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There was some resistance as Capsey defied her finger injury to make a fast start, before Wyatt joined her to put on 55 for the fourth wicket. However, just as England appeared to be getting back into the contest, Capsey offered up a gift, hitting Sharma's delivery straight to Verma at mid-off to give India the breakthrough. Another strong partnership of 65 followed between captain Jones and Wyatt, but when they were out in successive overs to leave England 169-6, the game was all but up.

The Vipers' victory on Wednesday means that they will take on the Northern Diamonds in the competition's final this Sunday at Lord's. The South East Stars won the toss, elected to bat and put together a target of 139, after finding themselves at 12-3 after just five overs and then 37-5. Jemima Spence delivered a much-needed 45 not out and was at the crease for a sustained period of time, while others came and went. Danielle Gregory put together the biggest partnership of the innings alongside Spence, but she was bowled out by Finty Trussler and in the end, the hosts were all out after 42.2 overs.

The pace bowler finished with five for 14 from seven overs, supported by Will Williams, who returned four for 24 as Essex lost their last nine wickets for 35 runs in pursuit of 98 to win. Only two Essex batters reached double figures against the telling and incisive bowling of the Lancashire duo, who helped their side to 19 points, whilst the hosts were left with a paltry three points after a dramatic Championship clash. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The demons of the previous day, when 26 wickets fell, continued to manifest themselves. Lancashire had resumed their second innings on 25 for six and lost another wicket 20 balls into the morning play. Debutant George Bell had looked settled while moving on to 24, the equal-highest score by a Lancashire player in the match. However, his 28-ball knock ended when he was bowled around his legs by Shane Snater to reduce Lancashire to 34 for seven. Snater had taken five for six in 4.2 overs at that stage. The two Toms, Bailey and Hartley, both hit successive boundaries in an uncharacteristically wayward over from Sam Cook that cost 17 runs. Bailey then threw the bat to the first ball of the next over, only to pick out Dan Lawrence on the long-leg boundary and hand Snater his sixth wicket and stunning figures of six for 10. Cook gained a measure of personal satisfaction when Hartley attempted an upper-cut to a short ball and only succeeded in edging behind. It was Cook's 200th first-class wicket for Essex. Simon Harmer had the last word when he struck Matt Parkinson full on the front pad to end the visitors' second innings inside 24 overs for a paltry 73. All-rounder Snater, Essex's player of the year, was rewarded for a breakthrough season with his county cap during the lunch interval. With the floodlights on throughout the day, the home side, seeking a third successive Championship victory in September, set out on the task of reaching a modest 98 runs for victory but, on this pitch, it was a tortuous task. Sir Alastair Cook and Nick Browne made a comparatively serene start to the chase, and had 24 on the board in seven overs to ease the nerves of the home camp when Browne was trapped lbw by Bailey. But the introduction of Balderson sent panic waves through the home camp. With his second delivery he had Cook beaten all ends up by one that ducked in and dislodged his leg bail. His next ball had Lawrence chipping carelessly to Williams at mid-wicket before the bowler breached Matt Critchley's defences to claim his hat-trick. Lunch arrived soon afterwards with Balderson feasting on figures of 2-2-0-3, while Essex tottered on 34 for four. The latest sacrificial lamb on a wicket denounced as unplayable by Lancashire head coach Glen Chapple was Feroze Khushi, bowled by Williams for a single as Essex wobbled further to 35 for five. Adam Rossington opted for aggression and collected two boundaries before Balderson wiped him out and, with the score on 55, Essex lost their seventh and eighth wicket, both to Williams. During all the carnage, skipper Tom Westley had stood firm but he finally succumbed for 13 having survived 41 balls when he was caught to become a fifth wicket for Balderson. Williams rounded off proceedings when he bowled Sam Cook to leave Lancashire celebrating victory in a match in which the four innings produced just 370 runs. Elsewhere, Surrey took a step closer to winning their second title in five years after forcing Yorkshire to follow-on at the Oval. The hosts' relentless seam attack bowled Yorkshire out for 179, and when bad light stopped play the visiting side were 89 for two, 65 behind, with Adam Lyth unbeaten on 36. Jack Leaning celebrated his second century of the season to boost Kent's hopes of avoiding relegation as they set Hampshire 378 to win. Stand-in captain Leaning struck 112 as Kent totted up 269. It meant Hampshire, who had seen Mohammad Abbas claim four for 68, required the fifth-highest chase in their history to keep themselves in the title race, with Surrey highly likely to pick up a win and six bonus points.", "azeem-rafiq-calls-for-yorkshire-racism-hearings-to-be-held-in-public": "Azeem Rafiq has written to the Cricket Discipline Commission urging it to hear allegations of racism at Yorkshire in public. The 31-year-old expressed a preference for a public hearing when the England and Wales Cricket Board announced in June that Yorkshire and a number of individuals had been charged over racism allegations made by Rafiq, and how those allegations were handled. The Daily Mail reported on Wednesday that Rafiq had sent a letter last week calling for the hearings - which are due to take place in the autumn - to be held publicly. The PA news agency understands Rafiq's letter expressed a loss of trust in the process and also offered the view that holding the hearings in public would offer transparency and bring closure to those involved. There is nothing within the CDC rules which states that hearings must be held in private. Only former Yorkshire captain and coach Andrew Gale has come out to confirm he is one of the individuals charged and has already said he will not engage with the process. Yorkshire announced last week they had agreed a settlement with Gale over his dismissal last December, accepting it had been \"procedurally unfair\". Rafiq is set to appear again before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee later this year, having given harrowing testimony about the abuse he suffered at Yorkshire to the same group of MPs last November. The committee is understood to be keen to hear from Rafiq again about a campaign to vilify him since that first appearance, and from Lord Patel about attempts to undermine the new regime at Yorkshire.

He comes in the middle order for England. \"[Ben] Duckett has done that role for a couple of counties. So, England doing the right things, getting the right players in the right positions. \"Leading up to a World Cup when everyone becomes available, when Ben Stokes becomes available, when Jos Buttler comes back in, then you're going to find the jigsaw a little bit tougher, but at the moment someone like Brook has come in and taken his chance beautifully.\" Watch England's tour of Pakistan live on Sky Sports.

The Division One leaders staggered to 136-5 after being asked to bat first but Yorkshire were unable to contain Pope, whose flip for six and a reverse sweep for four took him to a 102-ball ton. It was his 15th first-class century and 10th at the Micky Stewart Oval - renamed for this match in honour of the club great's 90th birthday - while Pope averages a fraction under 90 on his home ground. The England batter was cleaned up by Steven Patterson, the pick of Yorkshire's bowlers with four for 52, but Jordan Clark's unbeaten 55 helped Surrey to 292-6 before bad light ended the day early. Hampshire, who started the day just eight points behind Surrey, suffered a real blow to their title hopes after being skittled for their worst total since 1984. Kent were restricted to 165 at the Ageas Bowl, with Kyle Abbott taking 4-46, but that was put in the shade as Hampshire were all out for a meagre 57 in 16.5 overs. The innings lasted less than 90 minutes, with seven of their batters making less than three, as Matt Quinn finished with remarkable figures of 6.5-0-23-6. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Kent, though, slipped to 20-3 second time around to lead by 128 after an extraordinary day where 23 wickets fell on a surface which was helpful to seamers but not to an excessive degree. A total of 26 wickets fell at Chelmsford, with five-wicket hauls for Essex spinner Simon Harmer and Lancashire seamer Tom Bailey. Lancashire were all out for 131 after deciding to bat then lurched to 25-6, with Essex being rolled for 107 in between times. Sir Alastair Cook's 40 was the highest individual effort of the day. Dom Sibley's 105 not out ushered Warwickshire to 255-8 after winning the toss against Gloucestershire at Bristol. Danny Briggs added 65 but became Zafar Gohar's fourth wicket of the day. Somerset captain Tom Abell's 111 underpinned his side's 271-4 against Northamptonshire at Taunton, while George Bartlett chipped in with 62 after the hosts chose to bat first. Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire were frustrated by Brett D'Oliveira's 85 and Gareth Roderick's unbeaten 91 as Worcestershire went to stumps on 297-7 after being asked to bat at New Road. John Simpson's 92 plus half-centuries from Stephen Eskinazi (64) and Ryan Higgins (53) steered Middlesex to 293-8 after losing the toss against Leicestershire at Grace Road. Matthew Potts and Paul Coughlin took three wickets apiece as Sussex were dismissed for 162 against Durham, who had elected to field first and closed on 54-1 at Chester-le-Street.

With Karachi hosting England's first match in Pakistan since 2005, an excellent opening partnership between Mohammad Rizwan (68) and captain Babar Azam (31) thrilled the home crowd, before England hit back through Adil Rashid (2-27) and debutant Luke Wood (3-24) to limit them to 158-7. England then made a strong start to their run chase as Hales (53) anchored the innings, but regular Pakistan wickets ensured the game remained tense until Harry Brook (42 not out) produced a thrilling cameo to see the tourists home with four balls to spare. The victory gives England an early advantage in the seven-match series, as they seek to find form ahead of the start of the T20 World Cup in Australia next month. The return of Hales, who hadn't played international cricket for three years after being exiled over off-field issues, added another alternative look to an England side developing a new profile under head coach Matthew Mott and captain Jos Buttler, who were both appointed during the summer. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Moeen Ali captained England in the absence of Buttler, who is expected to return from a calf injury later in the series, with several other notable names, including Test captain Ben Stokes, left at home to rest ahead of the World Cup. \"I thought we were outstanding throughout,\" Moeen said. \"They got a great start. We pulled the game back really well in the middle period, and at the death in particular we were fantastic, and a lot of praise to the bowlers because they actually set the game up for our batters. \"On a difficult surface, I thought we played really, really well. We chased and timed it perfectly.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  England's long-awaited return to Pakistan was delayed when last year's planned tour was cancelled at short notice due to security concerns, but with two extra T20Is added to the original schedule, the excitement in the crowd was evident at the toss as loud cheers greeted Moeen and Babar in the middle, with England's stand-in skipper choosing to bowl after winning the toss. Pakistan had come into the series with questions over their opening partnership, but Rizwan and Babar quickly answered their critics, and gave the spectators further cause for excitement. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It was the Pakistan skipper who got off to a quick start, hitting Willey and Curran for boundaries in each of the opening overs. Rizwan would then join in, scoring boundaries off successive Willey balls in the following over as the hosts signalled their intent on what appeared to be a batter-friendly wicket. Even the introduction of England's spin duo Moeen and Rashid initially failed to slow Pakistan, with Rizwan bringing up his half-century by smashing the first maximum of the innings off the England captain. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  However, the first wicket would soon follow, with Rashid proving his worth once more as he bowled Babar with a brilliant googly that totally deceived the Pakistan skipper. From there, Pakistan would never regain momentum, as England limited their run rate and took regular wickets. Curran had Haider Ali caught on the boundary by Willey, before Moeen had Rizwan stumped by Salt. Rashid then took his second wicket as T20I debutant Shan Masood was caught attempting a reverse sweep. Lancashire left-armer Wood then finished the job, bowling Mohammad Nawaz for his first international wicket, before having Ishtikhar Ahmed and Naseem Shah caught. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It was only Ali, who took for 1-23 from his two overs, and Willey, who went for 41 from his four, who took any significant punishment from the Pakistan batters. Curran (1-30) and Gleeson 0-13) were both able to limit scoring opportunities. While all the attention was on the returning Hales, it was his opening partner Phil Salt who got England off to a fast start as they chased what appeared to be a relatively modest target on a ground that is known for being batting-friendly. Despite not showing much of the brutality that has marked some of his finest international innings, Hales kept calm as Salt (10), Dawid Malan (20) and Ben Duckett (21) were dismissed to keep Pakistan in touch. There was a little bit of fortune too, as he was put down twice by Pakistan. First Usman Qadir dropped a hugely difficult caught and bowled chance with Hales on 24, before Shan Masood floored a much easier opportunity on the boundary off the same bowler. While Hales' half-century on his return was undoubtedly a great comeback story, there was no doubt that Brook was England's most impressive batter on the day. The 23-year-old Yorkshire arrived at the crease with Hales having just been dropped by Pakistan and struggling for fluidity. The required run rate initially continued to rise as both Brook and Hales largely accepted working singles from Pakistan's spinners. The turning point came in the 15th over, as Brook played a brilliant ramp shot to send Shahnawaz Dahani's delivery over short fine leg for a boundary. With Babar forced to adjust his field, Brook then edged a full toss through the newly vacant third man for another four, before Hales sealed a fine over for England with a boundary down the ground. There was a similar pattern the following over, as Brook struck two more boundaries - the second a stunning check drive over mid-off - to put England on the brink of victory. Hales was caught off Haris Rauf as he attempted to accelerate to the target, but the result was never in doubt at that point, with Brook's seventh boundary appropriately sealing the win.

Smriti Mandhana was close behind with 111 runs and continued her good form with a match-winning 91 for the Indians at Hove in the ODI opener. The two play together at the Southern Brave in The Hundred, and Dunkley is yet to find an obvious weakness in Mandhana's batting. \"We had a couple of conversations about batting and other stuff, but Smriti is just a very good, very experienced player.

The 15-player group also features Conor Olphert and Craig Young, who return after missing August's 3-2 series win over Afghanistan in Stormont through injuries. Singh replaced McBrine for the final two games of that series and retains his spot in the squad. Graham Hume featured in the Afghanistan series, but has also been left out. The World Cup in Australia starts on 16 October and will be Ireland's first major tournament under head coach Heinrich Malan. Andrew White, who is the chair of the national men's selectors, said that it is \"an exciting time for Irish cricket\" and the World Cup is the \"beginning of a new era\". \"Over the last year we have been building a solid core squad, while creating more depth in our T20 cricket.

With George Dockrell and Gareth Delany both having an impact this summer and the variation they bring to the attack, it came down to making a choice between Simi Singh and Andy McBrine. \"Andy can feel very unfortunate to have missed out this time, but we believe Simi offers more variation on Australian wickets with his ability to take the ball away from both right and left-handers.\" Ireland will leave for Australia on September 29, playing three-warm up matches in Sydney, before two more warm-ups against Namibia and Sri Lanka in Melbourne.

Hales has convinced England's hierarchy that he is a risk worth taking having been called into the T20 World Cup squad as Jonny Bairstow's injury replacement. He may not have played for England since 2019 amid off-field issues, but his form, combined with Jason Roy's struggles and Bairstow's leg fracture whilst slipping at a golf course, has given him the chance of an unlikely comeback. Hales tested positive for recreational drugs in the build-up to the 2019 World Cup, an incident which then-white-ball captain Eoin Morgan said resulted in \"a complete breakdown in trust\" leading to his banishment from the squad. The Nottinghamshire batter had previously been suspended over his part in an altercation outside a Bristol nightclub in 2017, which saw England team-mate Ben Stokes charged with, but later cleared of, affray. And then in November last year, he apologised for \"all the offence\" he had caused after a photo showing him wearing black face make-up in 2009 was published. The explosive T20 opener, who helped propel England to No 1 in the world rankings and set two world-record one-day international totals, is back, but where has he been during his three-year exile? Hales had been in decent form during the English summer of 2019, helping Notts to the Vitality Blast semi-final. And just a month after being dropped by England, he was picked in the first round of the Caribbean Premier League draft for Barbados Tridents - the side that finished last in the previous season's league stage. Hales impressed in his first season, helping Jason Holder's Tridents to the title. In September 2019, the hard-hitting England star became the Durban Heat's new international marquee player after signing ahead of the Mzansi Super League season. \"Playing T20 cricket in South Africa is something that I have always wanted to do so when I was offered the role here it was no-brainer for me,\" he said. Once again, Hales impressed but not enough to help Durban make the play-offs. Having already enjoyed spells with the Melbourne Renegades, Adelaide Strikers and Hobart Hurricanes, Hales signed a one-year deal with Sydney Thunder for the Big Bash League in Australia. Sydney Thunder head coach Shane Bond said: \"He's one of the most destructive batters, is an outstanding fielder and is also obviously a highly experienced player.\" Hales went on to become the second-highest run scorer in the 2019 BBL with 576 at 38.40 and a strike-rate nearing 150. He also formed a brilliant opening partnership with Usman Khawaja. Alex Hales In May 2020, Hales said he had \"matured\" as a player and person and hoped to get back into England's international plans. Speaking to the Daily Mail, Hales said: \"I just hope the damage that's been done isn't terminal and I get another bite of the cherry. \"I certainly feel I have matured. As a player and away from the game, I've moved on and grown from the mistakes I've made in my private life and hopefully people can forgive and forget. \"I feel I'm in a good head space and hopefully I'll get the chance to show that in the group environment again. Obviously I'd love to get my place back, playing international cricket is the highlight of any player's career. \"Like Morgs (Eoin Morgan) has said, I guess time is the biggest healer. I just don't know how long that is going to go on for. It can be tough to rebuild that trust when you are not in the close-knit circles.\" In April 2020, Karachi Kings batsman Hales prompted the PCB to postpone the semi-finals and final of Pakistan Super League. Hales had sent a text message to Kings' owner at 2am admitting he was displaying Covid-19 symptoms. The final was eventually played in November with Hales in the Kings side which defeated Lahore Qalandars. In July 2020, Hales was named in the Barbados Tridents squad for the Caribbean Premier League where he was unable to guide them into the play-offs. Ahead of the Big Bash in Australia that winter, Hales was forced into 14 days of hotel quarantine after leaving the UK. \"Yeah it was tough - punishing is one way to describe it. it was an interesting couple of weeks not seeing daylight or getting fresh air,\" he said. \"It was a new experience but it was definitely worth it now to get the chance to play in the Big Bash. There's a bit more freedom here than you get back home as well. \"It's obviously really tough to leave home at any time. For me personally, I have refreshed and only played a month and a half of cricket and it wasn't in bubbles in the UK. \"I'd be a lot more fresh than some of those guys that have been in bubble life since June or July, so I can definitely see where they are coming from. It's such a huge strain on your mental and physical health to be in those bubbles. \"Personally I am fresh and looking forward to the next couple of months.\" The imposing figure of Hales ended up as top scorer, helping Thunder finish fifth. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Hales gave selectors a timely reminder of his abilities with a batting masterclass for Nottinghamshire during the 2021 T20 Blast with a blistering 482 runs at a strike rate of 178. Yet England selectors continued to ignore Hales again ahead of the ODI and T20 Pakistan series following a coronavirus outbreak in the bio-bubble. Michael Vaughan took to Twitter to vent his frustration at Hales' latest snub. \"So No Alex Hales that must be the end of his international career then find it very sad that someone who made a huge mistake but was punished can't be given another go,\" Vaughan wrote on Twitter. \"We all mistakes every week!!! Those that say they don't are lying,\" added Vaughan. Hales spent the winter in Australia - where he contracted Covid-19 - for the BBL with Thunder, and at the Pakistan Super League with Islamabad United. He briefly pulled out of the PSL before returning, but he eventually opted to take a break from the franchise scene due to the restrictions of bio-secure environments which he admits affected his mental health. \"I am truly gutted to have to turn down one of the best opportunities of my career due to the toil that the last two years of bubble life has taken on my mental well-being. I'll now take some time to rest and recharge ahead of the summer,\" said Hales.

Now 21, Cox came in at 74-4 in the 12th over of that final, first stemming the flow of wickets with 20 from 17 balls. However, in the latter half of his innings he scored a late flurry of boundaries to finish on 58 not out from 28 balls, becoming the youngest man to score a half-century in a Blast final and the second youngest to score one on Finals Day after Buttler. He has also impressed with his athleticism in the field, including a moment of magic in the same final. Cox has also played eight matches for the Oval Invincibles in The Hundred, scoring 191 runs this season. This included 39 from 30 against the London Spirit, 61 from 33 against the Trent Rockets, and 32 from 29 against the Birmingham Phoenix in losing efforts. Cox also scored 48 from 29 balls in a three-wicket victory over the Northern Superchargers, and he made his first-class, List A and T20 debuts for Kent in 2019 and has become a key member of England's under-19 side, scoring centuries against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

Jacks, 23, impressed for Surrey during their County Championship-winning season in 2018, scoring his maiden county century against Gloucestershire at The Kia Oval in the One-Day Cup. In July 2021, he scored English cricket's third-fastest T20 fifty from 15 balls against Middlesex and was among a host of uncapped players named in a replacement England ODI squad for the series against Pakistan after a Covid outbreak forced those originally selected into isolation. But he was not selected during England's impressive 3-0 series victory. A tall, clean-hitting batsman, Jacks has impressed since breaking through in 2019, most recently during The Hundred, where he has scored 261 runs, including the highest score in the tournament's history, a 108 from 48 balls. At the age of 28, Stone will have hoped to feature more regularly in England squads, but he has had an injury-plagued career. However, when fit, he has regularly bowled some of the fastest spells in county cricket. Back trouble affected the early part of his career, but Stone made his Test debut in 2019 against Ireland at Lord's. He has taken 10 first-class wickets for England and a solitary wicket in his four international ODI appearances. Despite the injuries, Stone, who has signed for Nottinghamshire from next season, is still regarded as one of the quickest bowlers in England and will hope he can put his fitness problems behind him in Pakistan. Called up to the England ODI squad against the Netherlands earlier this year, Wood has been around the set-up, but will be hoping to earn his first T20 cap in Pakistan. Wood burst onto the scene in 2015 with Nottinghamshire, but found opportunities limited with competition from the likes of Stuart Broad, Jake Ball, Luke Fletcher and Harry Gurney. He went out on loan twice, first to Worcestershire, featuring prominently in the T20 title success in 2018, making it back-to-back titles after helping the Outlaws lift the trophy the previous year. He then moved to Northamptonshire, taking his maiden first-class five-wicket haul and scoring a half-century at Old Trafford against Lancashire. Returning to Nottinghamshire in 2019, he took two wickets in his first over during a Vitality Blast match. A left-arm swing bowler, Wood joined Lancashire at the end of the 2019 season after spending time in and out of the side at Nottinghamshire and this year he was drafted by the Trent Rockets for The Hundred.

England, under stand-in captain Amy Jones, won the T20 international series 2-1 but a clinical performance saw the tourists triumph in the first of three 50-over matches. Early wickets from Jhulan Goswami (1-20) and Meghna Singh (1-42) put the home side under early pressure and despite Alice Davidson-Richards' (50no) maiden ODI fifty, England posted an under-par 227-7. India made light work of the chase with Mandhana putting on 96 with Yastika Bhatia (50 from 47 balls) and then 99 with captain Harmanpreet Kaur (74no) to help her side get over the line with 35 balls to spare. The tone for the match was set early with a miserly opening spell from 39-year-old Goswami, who is set to retire after the third ODI at Lord's on Saturday, in which she trapped Tammy Beaumont (7) lbw after Meghna had removed Emma Lamb (12) with a short ball. England ended the powerplay 26-2 but although India were making it tough to score, Sophia Dunkley and Alice Capsey, on debut, managed to rebuild with a stand of 43. The pair were starting to find some rhythm with 18-year-old Capsey (19) showing flashes of why she is considered such an exciting talent with some eye-catching shots. However, she fell to Sneh Rana after a fantastic diving catch from Kaur, who took it low down at mid-wicket, and England's momentum was halted. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Dunkley (29) survived two lbw reviews before chipping Harleen Deol tamely to cover and when Jones was bowled by a Rajeshwari Gayakwad delivery that stayed low, the hosts were in trouble at 94-5. Danni Wyatt was doing her best to keep the innings together and was scoring more freely than most of her team-mates as the India spinners took hold, but was tempted into a sweep shot by Deepti Sharma and struggled to hide her frustration as the ball skidded under her bat to hit leg stump. From 128-6, Davidson-Richards and Sophie Ecclestone put on 50 for the seventh wicket with the former playing a measured knock while the latter was quick to punish any loose deliveries. Sharma broke the stand with another ball that stayed very low to trap Ecclestone (31) lbw and although Davidson-Richards - who reached her half-century in the last over - and Charlie Dean (24no from 21) adding an unbroken stand of 49 to end the innings, it was India on top at the halfway stage. Kate Cross dismissed Shafali Verma in the second over of the India chase - Dean taking a flying catch at mid-wicket - to give England early hope of defending such a modest total but those hopes soon faded as Mandhana and Yastika found their stride. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  With the home side unable to replicate India's discipline in the early stages and captain Jones choosing to hold back star bowler Ecclestone, the visitors quickly worked themselves into a position of dominance that they would maintain throughout the innings. Yastika had a couple of moments of good fortune with a glove behind down leg off Issy Wong that Jones could only turn around the post and then a pair of top-edged pulls off Davidson-Richards that did not go to hand. However, for the most part, the India No 3 was in good touch as she took the attack to the England bowlers while Mandhana was batting with all the elegance and conviction that we have come to expect of such a fine player. The two left-handers seemed to have England exactly where they wanted them for a time before Yastika became a little fidgety and, two balls after bringing up a 45-ball half-century, charged Dean (1-45) and was bowled through the gate. Kaur came in and had the luxury of being able to play herself in while Mandhana ticked over at the other end, easing to her 24th ODI fifty. The experienced India pair managed the chase comfortably for the next 19 overs but with just 30 needed for victory and a Mandhana century seeming a formality, the left-hander skied a slower ball from Cross and was caught at mid-on, nine runs short of a sixth ODI ton. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  With Mandhana gone, England were able to put the squeeze on India. That did not stop Kaur getting to her 17th ODI half-century from 80 balls - a composed knock from the skipper. Kaur made sure it never got jittery for her side, thumping boundaries off Ecclestone and Davidson-Richards to ease the nerves and sealed the win with a six off Davidson-Richards in the 45th over. England captain Amy Jones: \"Disappointing. We didn't have enough runs, that's the main problem. Alice batted brilliantly through the middle and at the end to give us a chance. But we needed a few wickets in the powerplay, only got the one and that's where we fell short. \"We thought it was a trickier wicket but India bowled well and put us under pressure. Then losing regular wickets, it was hard to get going until we got that partnership with Alice and Soph. Regular wickets cost us.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Player of the match, India batter Smriti Mandhana: \"I would have enjoyed it more if I'd been not out for the team but I'm glad we could put on a show for the India fans. \"The one-day format is a very natural game for me because I like to go out there and time the ball. It's really important to give a good start and regardless of the format, it's great to score runs for India.\" India captain Harmanpreet Kaur: \"We are very happy with the win today, it was an important game for us. It was a very crucial toss to win and once we got that momentum we wanted to keep it. \"It was a great partnership [with the new ball] between Jhulan and Meghna Singh. Those breakthroughs were really important so credit goes to all the bowlers.\" Former England bowler Steven Finn: \"England will look back at it and think that they didn't build enough big partnerships. They got going and started to threaten to build a partnership that might take them to a big total but never managed that. India were outstanding with the ball, both their plans and the way they executed them. \"Then on the reverse side, India had great impetus at the top of the order with Bhatia and the two experienced campaigners of Mandhana and Hamranpreet. They shared a great partnership which broke the back of the chase.\" Watch the second ODI between England and India from 12.30pm, Wednesday on Sky Sports Cricket.

So hopefully I've been able to help even if it's not been on the pitch. \"It's really exciting we've got competition for places now.\" Cross saw enough from India in the T20 games to expect a tough challenge in the longer format over the three-match series. \"We've learnt that India are a very good side,\" she said. \"When we've played good cricket, we've dominated them, and moving into the ODIs that's what you'd look to do in the change of format over a longer period of time. \"We know that it will be a tough series, especially on the back end of a summer where pitches have been used. \"And we've had a lot of cricket under our belts this summer, so we know we're going to have to work hard this last week.\" Alice Capsey and Freya Kemp have been rewarded for their fine T20 form with first call-ups to the ODI squad, and Cross says the two teenagers have been superb for the group. \"They've been so impressive.

Having not played in the County Championship since May, Stevens is uncertain as to whether he will feature in Kent's final two games of the campaign. \"It will be emotional,\" said Stevens on Espncricinfo. \"We've had too much thinking time this week.

The veteran all-rounder has repeatedly voiced his interest in stepping into a coaching role at Canterbury, though it appears Kent have elected against taking him up on the offer for now. \"I don't want to fight any more,\" Stevens said of his departure. \"I feel like for the last five years I've been fighting for a contract where in three of those five years I've got Player of the Year, so I don't know how that actually works. \"It was gut-wrenching and really disappointing and it still hurts because I feel like I still have a lot to give for Kent cricket, on and off the pitch.

George Bartlett had earlier reached his sixth first-class century with 111 after Somerset had resumed the final morning on 277-4, already 300 ahead. Warwickshire, though, were able to navigate the rest of the final day, as Sam Hain made an unbeaten 52, while Dom Sibley (54) and Alex Davies (58) both added half-centuries. In Division Two, Middlesex swept aside Glamorgan by 10 wickets at Lord's and leapfrogged their opponents in the battle to secure promotion. Middlesex needed less than an hour on the final morning to seal a comprehensive victory, which puts them 12 points clear of Glamorgan with two matches to play. Seamer Toby Roland-Jones finished with figures of 5-61 as Glamorgan were bowled out for 220 in their second innings, with Surrey openers Mark Stoneman (20no) and Sam Robson (25no) knocking off the 45 runs needed for victory in only 5.2 overs. An unbeaten century from Tom Alsop helped Sussex secure a draw against Worcestershire, inflicting a potentially fatal setback to the visitor's own promotion ambitions. Alsop's 137no - his fourth Championship hundred of the season - and valuable contributions from Oli Carter (55) and Ali Orr (48) took Sussex to 312-6, a lead of 92, when the players shook hands with 13 overs remaining. Worcestershire picked up 14 points, but they are 28 behind second-placed Middlesex heading into the final two games. Durham needed only 37 minutes to wrap up a seven-wicket victory over Leicestershire at the County Ground. Michael Jones, who fell three runs short of a century in the first innings, added a 58-ball fifty before Durham, chasing 105, completed their win.

Coming into the summer, England had won only won one of their prior 17 Test matches, a run of form that led to former director of England men's cricket, Ashley Giles, and head coach, Chris Silverwood, losing their jobs. Key was appointed as Giles' replacement in April and was tasked with finding a new coach and captain to lead the Test team, following Joe Root's resignation as skipper, and ultimately settled on McCullum and Stokes.

The death of Queen Elizabeth II last week was marked with a minute's silence and the national anthem before play across the country. Opening batter Gay was fantastic in his 145, his third first-class century and second of the season, as he helped his side seamlessly score 249 for four having been stuck in to bat. He was joined in a 77-run first-wicket partnership by Will Young and a 155-run fourth-wicket stand by Rob Keogh, with a Kemar Roach and Dan Worrall-induced wobble in between. Keogh ended the day on an effortless 75 not out but was outshone by Gay's personal best. Sam Cook reached 200 first-class career wickets in record-breaking fashion as Essex bowled Yorkshire out for 134 during a bowler-friendly opening day at Headingley. In returning an excellent three for 31 from 15 overs, the 25-year-old England Lions seamer became the first English bowler in more than half a century to bring up the double hundred at an average under 20. Cook, whose 201 wickets have come at 19.56 apiece, achieved a feat last secured by Derbyshire's Alan Ward in 1971 and took advantage of helpful conditions to vindicate captain Tom Westley's decision to bowl first at the start of the two counties' 12th match of 14 in Division One. He was ably backed up by fellow seamer Shane Snater's three for 39, while Jamie Porter and Ben Allison claimed two wickets apiece as the hosts were bowled out just before tea, George Hill top-scoring with 36. There was no play possible beyond tea, taken at 3pm, due to rain, with Essex's innings not starting. Lewis Gregory's defiant half-century underpinned Somerset's dogged fightback on a weather-affected opening day of their relegation battle with Warwickshire at Edgbaston. After choosing to bat on a slow, turning pitch, the visitors closed on 182 for eight with Gregory unbeaten on 60 from 93 balls, which included four fours and four sixes, having supervised an impressive recovery from a parlous 82 for seven. Somerset were in deep trouble after Mohammed Siraj got among the wickets on his Warwickshire debut, taking four for 54. But Gregory batted with great determination and nous to add 58 with Josh Davey for the eighth wicket and an unbroken 42 with Sajid Khan for the ninth. His work meant that this crucial match between the two sides currently straddling the Division One relegation line ended a truncated first day, when 40 overs were lost to rain and bad light, pretty much even. Glamorgan bowler James Harris returned to haunt his former team-mates as he bowled his side back into contention on day one of their Division Two clash with fellow promotion contenders Middlesex at Lord's. With Middlesex 90 for one in reply to the visitors' 214 all out, Harris produced a burst of three for no runs in nine balls from the Nursery End, reducing the hosts to 92 for four and evoking memories of his greatest ever spell of nine for 34 against Durham at the home of cricket in 2015. Mark Stoneman witnessed the carnage from the other end to remain unbeaten on 72 with Middlesex 132 for four when bad light ended play four overs before the scheduled close. Earlier Chris Cooke was the mainstay of Glamorgan's innings with 52, Ryan Higgins taking four for 59 in his first game since returning to the county from Gloucestershire and John Simpson taking five catches behind the stumps. Joe Leach took his 400th first-class wicket as Worcestershire dominated Sussex on day one at Hove to keep their slim promotion hopes alive. The Pears realistically need to win all three remaining Division Two games and put themselves in a strong position after dismissing Sussex for 220, with Leach claiming four for 37. That modest total represented a recovery by Sussex who had been 23 for five before half-centuries by Fynn Hudson-Prentice, James Coles and Jack Carson revived them. But the pitch held few terrors for Worcestershire's openers Ed Pollock and Jake Libby, who posted 87 without loss before bad light ended play six overs early. Leicestershire and Durham had the rare experience of being frustrated by the weather on day one at the Uptonsteel County Ground. Only 22 overs were possible before rain forced the players off the field for an early lunch just after midday, with Leicestershire 97 for two, debutant Sol Budinger on 63 not out - despite having to change his bat after Ben Raine knocked a chunk out of it with the first ball of the day.", "mark-boucher-to-step-down-as-south-africa-coach-after-t20i-world-cup": "Cricket South Africa has announced men's head coach Mark Boucher will step down from his role at the conclusion of the T20I World Cup in Australia.

And swing, the ball did. Broad got things going with the wicket of Elgar (36) as the third vociferous lbw appeal of the 22nd over was met in the affirmative by umpire Nitin Menon. Elgar himself seemed convinced, too, walking off even before the finger was raised. A decision made all the stranger by the fact ball-tracking showed it would have missed leg stump. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  England were up, though, Broad had 564 Test wickets to move ahead of the great McGrath and into fifth on the all-time wicket-takers list. No 565 came soon afterwards when Ryan Rickelton (8) was trapped plumb lbw, hit on the back shin, and in between those two wickets, Anderson had done for Petersen (23) - Ollie Pope taking a smart catch at fourth slip. Sensing the game was getting away from them, Khaya Zondo and Wiann Mulder opted to dig in, setting out their stall to defend and try to blunt England's hugely-skilled and vastly-experienced seam duo. The result was more than an hour without a boundary and even singles were scarce. Robinson eventually broke the stalemate, a 50th wicket coming in just his 11th Test as Mulder (14) dragged the ball onto his stumps via his back leg, before pinning Zondo (16) in front with a big nip-backer in his next over to leave the visitors six down. Meanwhile, Stokes was battling through knee pain in a fine spell from the other end and looked to have earned his reward when Jansen nicked an out-swinger to Pope. His smile turned to a grimace, though, as the umpire stuck out his arm to signal that he had overstepped. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The England skipper belatedly got his man in the last over before tea. A hooping in-swinger beat Jansen (4) on the inside edge and flattened leg stump. Stokes had two balls to complete his over after the break and the second of them saw Rabada prod tamely to Harry Brook at third slip. Kyle Verreynne and Keshav Maharaj added a few useful runs in the next few overs but then fell in the space of six balls - the latter bowled by a beauty from Broad and the former caught and bowled by Anderson. Once again, England's openers - despite their recent shortage of runs - came out with the idea of imposing themselves on the South African bowlers. The risk of that strategy was shown first ball as Lees tried to punch through the covers and sent an outside edge to Jansen, who was unable to cling on at fourth slip. Lees was then nearly run out, a direct hit from point making it very tight but the third umpire adjudged that the England left-hander got his bat down in the nick of time. His eventful start to the innings was completed with an unsuccessful South Africa review for a catch after the ball ballooned into the cordon. A boundary muscled down the ground next ball was just the response the crowd wanted to see. Crawley, meanwhile, delighted the crowd with back-to-back boundaries off Rabada - the first powered through point before the next was driven elegantly through mid-on. Lees tried one more big shot, a top-edged pull off Jansen that just evaded Maharaj at mid-off, before the batters settled down for a time. The 50 partnership brought a huge ovation from the south London crowd and despite a period of restraint, Crawley was soon approaching a half-century of his own. Rabada was drilled through the covers and then pulled disdainfully through mid-wicket to take Crawley to a sixth Test 50 after a run of 16 innings without one, in which time he made 10 single-figure scores. Any luck that he may feel deserted him in that time came back to him shortly after the standing ovation that greeted his milestone had ended. A fierce pull shot was put down by Rickelton at mid-wicket and later in the over, an outside edge flew between wicketkeeper and first slip. South Africa captain Dean Elgar managed a wry smile, bowler Anrich Nortje wore a rather different expression. Lees ended the next over by thumping Jansen through the covers for four and it looked as though the victory would come quickly. Instead, with the light fading, the umpires decided they needed to take the players off and, although an unpopular decision, it will have little impact on the result. After just two days of play, England are on the verge of another victory under Stokes and Brendon McCullum.

India lost the toss and were sent out to bat in tough conditions as spinner Glenn amassed career-best figures of 4-23 while tail-ender Deepti Sharma top-scored with an unbeaten 29 to leave the visitors 132-7 after their allotted overs. Dunkley made light work of the run chase after an early wicket scare in the first over, finishing the job 61 not out off 44 balls alongside Alice Capsey (32 off 20 deliveries) to lead England to their target of 133 after just 13 overs. Amy Jones captained the side in place of Nat Sciver, who withdrew from the England squad earlier this week to focus on her mental health. The two teams honoured Queen Elizabeth II prior to the start of play with a minute's silence, as had been the case earlier in the day ahead of the men's Test against South Africa. India started brightly with the bat and made 30 before Smriti Mandhana (23 off 20 deliveries) was trapped lbw by spinner Byrony Smith immediately after England had unsuccessfully reviewed a wicket appeal having caught the opener's pads. Smith was involved again shortly after when she caught Shafali Verma for 14 at long-on off the bowling of Glenn, who brought up her second wicket moments later by dismissing Dayalan Hemalatha with a straight forward lbw decision for the umpires. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (20 off 15 deliveries) showed nice touch upon arrival and, alongside Richa Ghosh (16 off 12 deliveries), helped India retake control of the contest before the latter was caught by Smith off Freya Davies to leave the visitors 83-4 after 11.4 overs. Kaur was then undone by a low ball from Glenn to peg her side back to 88-5 an over later. England would concede just eight runs across the 16th, 17th and 18th overs before Pooja Vastrakar was run out for three for 119-7 after failing to slide her bat while coming back for a second. Dunkley escaped an immediate setback for England after clipping behind to the lightning hands of Ghosh on the third ball, prompting Indian celebrations only for the wicket to be scratched off for a no-ball. England capitalised on the early fortune to take 13 off the second over, during which India's Radha Yadav was forced off after landing awkwardly on her right shoulder at backward point. She was subsequently replaced in the field by Simran Bahaduris. Having finished the powerplay 56-0, the opening partnership was finally broken when Danni Wyatt (24 off 16 deliveries) was stumped by Ghosh after shuffling down the pitch to Sneh Rana. That would prove the sole hiccup on the way to victory for England, Dunkley and Alice Capsey punishing poor fielding with clinical batting to reach a 51-run partnership from 26 balls that left them needing just 22 from 58. Dunkley brought up a second IT20 half-century off 36 balls while Capsey matched her aggression with a quickfire 32 to carry their team over the line with some ease.

A remarkable morning at the Kia Oval began with a poignant tribute to mark the passing of Queen Elizabeth II. Once play began, England's seamers quickly found their rhythm as six wickets went down in the first 12 overs and, despite a little resistance from the lower order, the Proteas were all out midway through the afternoon session. Stuart Broad took 4-41 and James Anderson (1-16) claimed the other wicket. Despite losing their openers early, England raced to 84-2 at tea and looked set for a sizeable first-innings lead before being reduced to 154-7, a lead of 36, at the close as South Africa fought back courtesy of Marco Jansen's 4-34. With plans to honour the Queen prior to the start of play, the vast majority of a capacity crowd were in their seats early and a hush fell over the ground as a military guard of honour was formed. The umpires and both teams walked out to near-silence and lined up in front of the Micky Stewart Pavilion for the official minute's silence, which was ended by one chime of the bell by Senior NCO Robert Brockelsby Miller of the Irish Guards. That was followed by the national anthems, sung by Laura Wright, culminating in a rendition of God Save the King. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  After a washout on day one and the cancellation of Friday's play as a mark of respect, there were only three days to force a result and find a series winner. England's best chance was to bowl South Africa out cheaply and build a lead that would ensure they only had to bat once in the match - and the bowlers wasted little time in doing their part. Robinson uprooted Dean Elgar's (1) off stump in the second over and six balls later, Anderson had Sarel Erwee (0) caught behind. Keegan Petersen (12) was next to go, misjudging a leave off Robinson and allowing the ball to thud into his off stump. The wickets kept coming with Ryan Rickelton (11) feathering Broad behind; Robinson snared Kyle Verreynne with a beauty three balls later and when Wiann Mulder edged behind with an extremely loose drive, South Africa were 36-6. Khaya Zondo, playing his first Test innings, and Jansen stayed together for close to an hour to see their side through to lunch, but the former departed soon after. Having survived the second of two England reviews - one for caught behind, the other for lbw - earlier in the over, Zondo (23) dollied a catch to Alex Lees after Broad's delivery had reared up to take the shoulder of the bat. Broad was in the middle of a brilliant spell, but his luck deserted him for a time as numerous balls flew past the outside edge and, twice in the same over, Jansen was dropped off his bowling. First Ben Foakes and then Ollie Pope shelling chances they would have expected to take. Jansen (30) could not make it count, though, and sent a thick edge to Joe Root at first slip to give Robinson his third five-wicket haul in Tests. It was left to Broad to wrap up the innings with the wickets of Keshav Maharaj (18) and Anrich Nortje (7). For the second match in a row, South Africa posted their lowest score in England since readmission. Knowing time was of the essence, England came out with a clear positive intent and Lees swiftly reached 13 from five balls. However, the sixth - bowled by Jansen - snuck through his defences and hit the top of middle stump. Zak Crawley (5) had driven Kagiso Rabada for four in the first over of the innings but got stuck thereafter and was eventually dismissed by Jansen, taking a review with him after being trapped plumb lbw. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Root came out to join Ollie Pope, who was batting with all the confidence of a man who averaged 88.54 on his home ground, and for a time the pair seemed to go shot for shot as the home crowd roared their approval. The momentum shifted in the first over after tea. Root (23) went hard at a ball wide of off, a thick outside edge went quickly and Petersen held on to a sharp catch at third slip. Harry Brook, on debut, was given a warm reception by the crowd and got off the mark in Test cricket with a lovely cover drive. However, after a brief rain delay, the Yorkshireman miscued a pull shot and was caught at fine leg to give Jansen his fourth wicket. Ben Stokes came and went quickly with the ultra-attacking approach we have become accustomed to not paying off on this occasion. Having been dropped a couple of balls earlier, Stokes (6) fiddled at a ball outside off from Nortje and edged to first slip. Meanwhile, Pope (67) had brought up his ninth Test half-century with the 10th boundary of an enterprising innings, but he was following Stokes back to the dressing room in the next over. A thin nick behind giving the unusually expensive Rabada his first wicket of the day and when Broad (6) tickled behind on the hook, the South Africa pacer had two. Three balls later and with blue skies overhead and the floodlights on, the umpires took the players off for bad light. Despite the frustrations of the fans, that proved to be it for day three and Foakes (11no) and Robinson (3no) will resume on Sunday morning as England try to build a more substantial lead.

They both came in with a clear plan - to play front foot, enjoyable and fun Test cricket. Announcing Stokes' appointment in April, Key said the all-rounder \"epitomises the mentality and approach we want to take this team forward\". The appointments have been vindicated, with England winning six Tests out of seven this summer, losing only one. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Here are six key moments from England's Test summer. There was an air of uncertainty and excitement going into the first Test of the summer against New Zealand at Lord's. Ben Stokes went into the Test against the ICC world champions with a new opening pair, Ollie Pope in at No 3, veteran bowlers James Anderson and Stuart Broad recalled and a debut given to Durham seamer Matthew Potts. England bowled first and managed to restrict New Zealand to a first innings score of 132, a target that looked easy for England to match, only for the Kiwis to restrict them to a nine-run lead. A 195-run stand between Daryl Mitchell and Tom Blundell set England a tough target, which looked too much after falling to 69-4. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In came Stokes, joining Root at the crease with a mammoth task in front of him. But rather than enter a shell and steady the ship, Stokes countered - scoring 54 in 110 balls. By the time he was caught by Blundell, England were 159-5, with just over 100 runs for Root and Ben Foakes to chase down. Free from the burdens of captaincy, Root scored his first fourth innings century, while Foakes supported him admirably, guiding England to a five-wicket win in four days. The match ebbed and flowed, it was a sign of things to come, not just against New Zealand but through the summer. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Going into the summer, several key players' positions in the starting XI were questioned, including Jonny Bairstow. The Yorkshireman had performed in fits and starts for England's red-ball team, but under Root, he struggled to make a mark on games. This changed over the summer. Bairstow scored over 1,000 runs before he missed the last Test match against South Africa with a \"freak\" injury. This included four centuries and two half centuries. His match-winning knocks against New Zealand in the second and third Test were excellent, but it was his performance against India in the rescheduled fifth Test that stood out. Stokes' side chased 378 runs by India in the fourth innings - a record target for an England team and the fifth-highest overall in Test history. After a solid foundation was set by openers Alex Lees and Zak Crawley, Bairstow joined Root, with England on 109-3. Root played with his usual poise, and Bairstow backed up his first-innings century with an excellent 114 off 145 balls. Going into day five, Root and Bairstow resumed on 259-3 and breezed beyond 300, sapping any remaining enthusiasm from an embattled India attack that did not even get their hands on the second new ball as England stormed home in 76.4 overs at an incredible run rate of 4.93. It was a remarkable turnaround for Bairstow, with the India match epitomising what Stokes and McCullum are trying to achieve in England's red ball reset. Stokes, Root, Ollie Pope and Foakes have impressed with the bat this summer, but Bairstow has stood out as the key man in the middle order. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For the first time under Stokes, England were put into bat by Dean Elgar in the first Test against South Africa. Until then, England batted second, something which allowed their front-front batting ethos to really flourish. But against South Africa, England came unstuck, losing by an innings and 11 runs. Only Pope, Stokes, Broad and Jack Leach reached double figures - with Pope steadying the first innings with 73 off 102. The opening pair of Lees and Crawley lost their wickets cheaply, and England could only manage to post 165. In response, Elgar's side hit 326 as England's bowlers toiled. On recent form, England may have expected to overhaul South Africa's total, but they failed to do so, succumbing to a loss in three days. While they responded in emphatic fashion - beating South Africa in three days in the second Test, questions remain over England's batting line-up's ability to set a score. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  England have been searching for a solid opening pair for several years since Sir Andrew Strauss and Sir Alastair Cook retired. Many have tried, few have succeeded, but it seems as if Stokes has backed Lees and Crawley as his opening pair. Aside from an excellent partnership in the fifth Test again India, neither pair have set the world alight. Both made some good starts and showed signs of something resembling an opening pair, including good partnerships in the first Test against New Zealand and in the India Test. But neither made a century this summer, with Lees scoring 327 runs in seven matches, including two half centuries. Crawley's position in the side has also been questioned, he lost his wicket twice in his 40s but only scored 276 runs this summer - a disappointing return. Both showed why Stokes has backed them, steering England to a win in the final Test against South Africa with Crawley scoring his first half-century of the summer. While the middle order, which includes Root, Bairstow, Stokes and Foakes, have played with an element of freedom, the opening pair have struggled. Stokes has stayed loyal and backed their pair, but England's next Test isn't until December in Pakistan so the selectors have a decision to make over the opening pair. The opening partnership is something Stokes will want to address sooner rather than later but at the moment it is a problem that has lingered from the end of the Root era. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Both Anderson and Broad were dropped for the final series of Root's captaincy, a decision that was questioned. England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker said at the time he felt \"frustration and anger\" at the decision, while Carlos Brathwaite said before the series that the omissions swung the balance in the West Indies' favour. While the decision to omit the pair is understandable - both bowlers are entering the twilight of their careers - England are lacking options in the seam bowling department. Ollie Robinson has had a good start to his Test career, Stokes continues to be a dangerous fourth seamer option but Jofra Archer, Mark Wood, Chris Woakes, Saqib Mahmood, Olly Stone and Matthew Fisher have all struggled with injuries and fitness problems. Broad has taken 33 wickets this summer, including a game-changing spell in the first Test against New Zealand, which resulted in three wickets in three balls at Lord's. It was a moment in the match that Broad has become synonymous for, and tilted the game in England's favour as New Zealand looked to build a big lead and in the final Test of the summer, he went past Glenn McGrath on the all-time leading wicket-takers' list and second on the all-time wicket-taking seamers, behind Anderson. Anderson's 22 wickets took him to No 3 in the all-time list of highest wicket-takers and included a five-wicket haul in the first innings against India. Both bowlers showed they can still perform on the biggest stage. However, they were supported brilliantly by fourth seamer Stokes - who took important wickets throughout the summer - and first Potts and later Robinson. Making your debut at the Home of Cricket is no mean feat, but Potts took to first-class cricket like a duck to water - taking four wickets, including Kane Williamson, in his first innings. He impressed throughout the series and backed it up with four wickets against India, including the scalp of Virat Kohli in the first innings. In his five matches for England this summer, he took 20 wickets, with an economy of 3.06 and best figures of 4-13. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Going into the summer, there were fitness concerns over Robinson, and he was not in the squad for the Tests against New Zealand and India. He returned for the last two Tests of the summer, and reminded the selectors of his ability, taking 17 wickets, including 5-49 and 2-30 in the final, shortened three-day match at the Kia Oval. Robinson was the pick of England's bowlers against South Africa and his first wicket in the second innings was his 50th for England in 11 matches. Jamie Overton replaced the injured Anderson for the second New Zealand Test and also impressed with the bat and ball. Stokes and McCullum clearly told the seamers to bowl full and go for wickets, something that has paid dividends this summer. They will now be hoping that the likes of Archer, Mahmood, Wood and Wokes can get fit to give him some excellent seamer options.", "nat-sciver-withdraws-from-england-womens-vitality-it20-series-against-india-to-focus-on-her-mental-health": "Nat Sciver has withdrawn from England Women's Vitality IT20 Series and Royal London Series against India to focus on her mental health and wellbeing.

Sciver said: \"I've played a lot of cricket over the last nine months and I am very emotionally fatigued. \"Elite sport demands a lot and for the moment I'm not able to perform without compromising my own wellbeing, so I need to take some time away from cricket in order to focus on myself. \"It's the right decision for me and it's the right decision for the team.\" Director of England Women's Cricket Jonathan Finch said: \"We fully support Nat and her decision to step away from this series.

Stokes took a break from the sport last year to focus on his mental health as he was suffering from a series of panic attacks following the loss of his father to brain cancer almost two years ago. The 31-year-old announced in July he would retire from one-day cricket citing the \"unsustainable\" rigour of playing all three formats of the game.

I am not embarrassed or ashamed to say it because I needed the help at the time,\" Stokes said in an Amazon documentary. \"But it's not done just because I'm back playing. I still speak to the doc, not as regularly, and I'm still taking medication every day. It's an ongoing process.\" Stokes said he felt deep resentment towards cricket due to a lack of support from some in the England hierarchy and pondered if he was \"playing for the wrong people\" because he had been unable to visit his dying father, Ged, who passed away in 2020 with brain cancer, as much as he wanted. \"So I had a real thing with cricket at the time I took a break. I was really angry at the sport because it was dictating when I could see my dad,\" he told the Telegraph in an interview. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Stokes began to struggle with anxiety and panic attacks and stressed the importance of opening up about mental health, ultimately stepping away from the sport, adding it was not human nature to pretend to be fine. \"I find sometimes people are a bit nervous to go into the detail about that kind of stuff with me.

Northamptonshire, resuming on 77 for one, faced a 225-run first-innings deficit, with Emilio Gay's classy 74 helping edge the visitors on to 153 for three at stumps - still 72 runs behind. Hampshire have the chance to move at least level with leaders Surrey, who do not play in this round, with a victory set to put them eight points clear. At Emirates Old Trafford, Luke Wells hit a 65-ball century to maintain Lancashire's hopes of victory over Roses rivals Yorkshire to keep themselves in the title hunt. Having resumed day three at 130 for four in reply to Lancashire's first-innings score of 276, Yorkshire were eventually bowled out for 255, seamer Tom Bailey taking four for 56 including his 300th first-class wicket.

Opening partner Keaton Jennings had made 68. Sam Cook took six for 33 as Essex pressed towards victory over Kent at Canterbury. Resuming at 74 for four in reply to Essex's first innings 573, Kent were dismissed for 164, with Ben Allison claiming four for 40. Despite Cook's haul - and Adam Rossington taking seven catches behind the stumps - Essex remained two wickets shy of victory, despite taking an extra half hour after the scheduled close with Jordan Cox remaining unbeaten on 53. Ben Charlesworth, Ollie Price and Miles Hammond all made half-centuries as Gloucestershire looked poised for a challenging declaration against Somerset at Taunton. The visitors began the day by bowling out Somerset for 248, from an overnight 209 for eight, as Tom Price completed figures of five for 75. Gloucestershire built on their first-innings lead of 95 to reach 246 for five - an advantage of 341 - which was supported by decent contributions from Charlesworth (64), Ollie Price (53) and Hammond (53).

Notts captain Steven Mullaney took three for 29 and Brett Hutton three for 51. India batter Shubman Gill was the star performer between the rain breaks, falling just eight runs short of a century on debut, as Worcestershire kept alive slim hopes of forcing victory over Glamorgan at Sophia Gardens.

They had some of the strongest, standout players throughout the tournament and played consistently fantastic cricket. There were many similarities in the winning bowling attacks but both teams' biggest weapon was their outrageous pace and swing up front with the ball, complimented by their power and flair hitters with the bat. Shabnim Ismail (Invincibles) and Luke Wood (Rockets) delivered a masterclass on how to hit dramatic speeds and still swing the new ball. Then Suzie Bates, Lauren Winfield-Hill (both Invincibles), Alex Hales and Dawid Malan (both Rockets) each deserve standing ovations for their run-scoring efforts across the tournament. What I loved about The Hundred this year was the breakthrough talent in the reigning champions' attack. Sophia Smale and Eva Gray came in from nowhere and absolutely owned the tournament. To give some context, when I say 'nowhere', Smale is 17 years old, has only played three games of domestic cricket for Western Storm, having prior to that only played academy cricket. She is not a professional cricketer and has taken to this tournament like a duck to water, taking eight wickets in seven games.

Stokes has not played a T20 international since March 2021 and averages a modest 20.09 with the bat in his 34 appearances, although he has batted in the top four on only three occasions. \"I'd like to get Stokes up the order a little bit,\" Key said. \"In T20 cricket, I feel that, generally, we haven't quite found his best role. Coming in later, that doesn't make the most of Stokes. \"Every time he has done well in the IPL, I would argue, is either when he has been opening the batting or has got in earlier - his team two or three down - and he has had the chance to influence a game. \"The knock-on effect of everything we're doing is that hopefully Stokes has a more fulfilled role in T20 cricket and we get the best out of him in the big games.\"", "jason-roy-england-opener-left-out-of-t20-world-cup-squad-and-for-preceding-pakistan-tour": "Jason Roy has been left out of England's squad for the T20 World Cup in October and for their T20 tour of Pakistan later this month following a poor run of form with the bat. Roy has struggled this summer, scoring just 78 runs in six T20 internationals, averaging 12.66. He also began his Hundred campaign for the Oval Invincible with three ducks in four innings. Phil Salt, who has played four T20Is and eight one-day internationals - scoring his maiden century against the Netherlands in June - has been named in both squads and could take Roy's place alongside white-ball captain Jos Buttler at the top of the order, or there could be a promotion up the order for Jonny Bairstow.

Both sides knew victory would see them into a clash with London Spirit on Friday for the right to face Trent Rockets in the final at Lord's. Little returned the best figures in the men's Hundred, taking 5-13 from his 20 balls, while Sam Billings' half-century guided the visitors to a competitive 143-9. Madsen's unbeaten fifty and late heroics from Paul Walter saw Originals home with a ball to spare. Originals got off to a great start with the ball having lost the toss, taking three wickets inside the powerplay. The hosts were brilliant in the field and the tone was set by Walter, who took a stunning diving catch in front of Old Trafford's party stand to dismiss Rilee Rossouw for 17. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Little backed that up with a superb set, taking the wickets of Jordan Cox and Will Jacks to leave the Invincibles 23-3. Billings and Sam Curran set about rebuilding patiently, taking the score to 64 for three at the halfway mark. Curran then launched a huge six off Tristan Stubbs as Invincibles looked to push the rate, but fell for 24 to Tom Lammonby in the next over to end the blossoming partnership at 56. Billings pushed on undeterred, smashing two sixes off Matt Parkinson's second set and passing his fifty from 30 balls. With 20 balls remaining, Invincibles were 115-4 but the Originals finished strongly. Billings fell to a brilliant catch from Tom Hartley to give Little his third before two smart bits of work from wicketkeeper Phil Salt - running out Tom Curran and correctly reviewing an edge off Hilton Cartwright - kept Originals on top. Little completed his superb five-wicket haul when Matt Milnes was caught for a duck and Gleeson struck in the final set to restrict Invincibles to 143. Originals flew out of the traps, racing to 34 from just 16 balls before Laurie Evans fell for nine - hitting Peter Hatzoglou straight to midwicket. They were 43 for one at the end of the powerplay, with Salt well set on 19. But three balls later the England batter attempted to hit Danny Briggs over the ropes and only found Cox as Invincibles landed a big blow. Madsen, who was reprieved by a DRS review, and Stubbs set about rebuilding - with a six from the latter helping the hosts to 74 for two at halfway, needing another 70. Stubbs picked out Sam Curran to hand Briggs a second, but Madsen looked in good touch as he brought up a 34-ball half-century to reduce the target to 33 from 20 balls. Ashton Turner hit Sam Curran for 14 from his five balls to seize control again, before Tom Curran went for just two from the penultimate set, with Turner also run out, to leave Originals needing 11 from five balls. Walter launched a huge blow which looked set to be caught, but Jacks could only tip the ball over the rope for six. It proved the key moment as Walter struck the winning run two balls later.

Both teams, out of finals contention before a ball was bowled, should have performed better with the bat on a pitch which was tired but not disastrously so. Harry Brook top-scored with 29 for the Superchargers, who were inserted by the reigning champions and made 135-8, while fledgling leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed and seamer James Fuller each finished with 2-20. In reply, Brave slumped to 34-4 in 26 balls and failed to recover. In posting 119 for nine, they suffered a fifth defeat in eight. Ahmed continued his impressive day with 33, but South African left-arm quick Wayne Parnell's outstanding 4-16 ensured the Superchargers finished with a fourth win added to as many defeats. After a breezy start, the Superchargers were checked by the varied spin of leg-spinner Ahmed, off-spinner Paul Stirling and left-armer Jake Lintott. The latter two struck once apiece. Three of their top four all reached 20 and failed to go on. After the early departure of captain Faf du Plessis to Ahmed, caught by mid-on running around towards mid-off, his opening partner Adam Lyth made 20, David Willey reached 22 and Brook with his aforementioned 29 before all holed out to catches in the deep as the score fell to 91 for four after 67 balls. Seamer Sonny Baker had Lyth caught at deep midwicket off a top-edge and Brook taken in the same position pulling before Ahmed struck again when Adam Hose found long-on.

Seamer Fuller removed Wiese and Adil Rashid in the penultimate set of five - again to catches in the deep. After being polished with the ball and in the field, the Brave were all over the place with the bat in the early stages of their reply, losing some serious firepower in the first 26 balls. Quinton de Kock was run out trying to take a risky single to short fine-leg before Parnell's left-arm seam accounted for Stirling and Alex Davies. Left-arm spinner Callum Parkinson then bowled captain James Vince to leave it 34-4, before Ahmed and Ross Whiteley steadied with a partnership of 27. However, when the latter miscued Rashid's leg-spin to long-on, leaving the score at 61-5 after 49 balls, it felt a decisive juncture. And so it proved. Tim David drilled Wiese to long-off shortly afterwards. Ahmed shared 28 in 26 balls with Fuller, both hitting strong shots down the ground, only for the former to miscue Parnell to long-on to leave the score at 104-7 after 83 balls with 32 runs still required. That target became 26 off 10, and it was all but game over when Parnell yorked Fuller for 25 to leave 22 still needed off six.

The Invincibles' score of 163-2 was powered by an unbeaten 79 from captain Suzie Bates, and they can now look forward to the showcase match at Lord's on Saturday against either Southern Brave or Trent Rockets. The Originals never got close, with the defeat ending their slim chance of qualification for the latter stages of the competition, despite 64 from Lizelle Lee in what could be her last match for the team. Teenager Sophia Smale and Marizanne Kapp, who enjoyed a good day with bat and ball, were the pick of the bowlers, both finishing with two wickets as the Originals were restricted to 131-6 in a dominant display for the London-based side. Knowing that a victory would guarantee them top spot and an automatic berth in the final, the Invincibles won the toss and chose to bat first, a decision justified by the fluent start provided by the experienced opening pairing of Bates and Lauren Winfield-Hill. The pair had raced to 62 in just 43 balls when Winfield-Hill was caught by Erin Burns in the deep off Emma Lamb for 25, but New Zealander Bates was undeterred, bringing up an impressive fifty off 33 balls, before Alice Capsey was bowled by Sophie Ecclestone for 18 trying to keep the runs flowing. That brought Kapp to the crease, returning to the team after missing the last two outings, and she and Bates played powerfully around the ground to elevate their team to an impressive 163 with an unbroken partnership of 67 from just 36 balls. Bates' innings of 79 featured nine fours and two sixes, while Kapp's 36 contained five boundaries, including one maximum. That total was just short of the overall record women's team total for The Hundred - 166 set by Southern Brave last year - but the Invincibles will take satisfaction from knowing their victory, coupled with the Brave's shock defeat to the Northern Superchargers earlier in the day, means they will avoid having to play in Friday's Eliminator at the Brave's expense. The Originals knew they had to chase the runs down in 72 balls for a spot in the play-offs, and that seemed unlikely when Lamb was bowled by Smale without scoring. Bates and Kapp then combined again, as Amy Satterthwaite was caught by the former off the latter's bowling for just two. Lee's lone hand was set against the wickets that tumbled around her. Burns was bowled by Smale for five, Ecclestone was caught by Capsey off Kapp for one, and Daisy Mullan was run out for nine on her Hundred debut. Lee reached her fifty off 34 balls before finally perishing for 64 off 41, caught on the boundary off Eva Gray, to a warm ovation from the appreciative home crowd. Ami Campbell restored some pride in the Originals' performance, striking a couple of boundaries in a run-a-ball 23, but it was not enough to save her side from elimination.

Laura Wolvaardt's continued run of fine form saw her score 50 off 35 balls as the Superchargers' posted 145-6. Brave could muster only 125-9 in reply and they face an anxious few hours to see whether Oval Invincibles leapfrog them after their trip to Manchester Originals. The size of victory for the Superchargers was not enough to secure their place in the knockout stages. Brave lost openers Danni Wyatt and Smriti Mandhana without scoring inside the first 10 balls of their reply, before Sophia Dunkley's 38 from 30 balls ended the Superchargers' slim hopes of qualification despite victory. Katie Levick and Alice Davidson-Richards took two wickets apiece. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  After being put into bat in front of a home crowd, Superchargers were faced with the early loss of Alyssa Healy, who rocketed a ball otherwise destined for the boundary straight into the hands of Dunkley at cover for 17. Wolvaardt set the tone for her side with the bat, forming a solid partnership with Heather Graham worth 45 off 27 balls. By the time Graham fell for a well-played 26 off 19, Superchargers were 98-4 with 26 balls still to come. Tickets for The Hundred are selling fast! If you want to be part of the action, go to thehundred.com/tickets Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wolvaardt's classy innings saw her pass the record for the most runs scored by any woman in the Hundred's short history, having racked up 286 across six innings before she was caught superbly on the boundary by Wyatt. A cameo from Jenny Gunn with 15 from seven balls after Wolvaardt's dismissal gave the Superchargers a whiff of qualification, setting the Brave a total of 145 to beat. The home side's hopes were boosted by a perfect start in the field, Wyatt falling off the first ball of the innings, caught at short leg, and her opening partner, the dangerous Mandhana, falling just eight balls later. As the Brave's batting line-up wobbled under pressure, Dunkley stood firm with wickets falling around her. Tahlia McGrath was bowled by the impressive Graham and Maia Bouchier was out caught to Davidson-Richards. By the time Georgia Adams nicked off a tempting delivery from Levick, Dunkley was the only thing standing between Superchargers and an unlikely qualification. Her steady innings of 38 off 30 came to an end caught on the boundary by who else but Graham, effectively taking the Brave's hopes of winning the game with her as she walked back to the dugout. A good partnership between Amanda-Jade Wellington and Freya Kemp worth 41 off just 18 ended the Superchargers' hopes of qualification, taking the visitors past the magic number 99, which had they failed to score would have potentially seen the Superchargers through. The bowlers could not see Brave home with the bat however and they finished on 125-9. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Laura Wolvaardt, Northern Superchargers said: \"It was lots of fun. I think we needed to restrict them to a bit less to qualify for the playoffs so it's bittersweet I guess, but happy to have beaten a really good side today. \"I thought the girls played exceptionally well, our fielding was excellent. Heather Graham took a screamer on the boundary and she was really good in the field today. \"It wasn't the ideal start but we just looked to take it as deep as we could. We know it's a really nice ground, a really fast outfield, so it was just about taking it as deep as we could. \"The fight from the girls today was incredible. We were really giving it our all to restrict them to what we needed, it just didn't quite work out but almost went to plan.\" At Old Trafford, the action gets underway with the women from 2.30pm on Sky Sports Mix, as the Manchester Originals aim to fight their way into the play-off places, facing the Oval Invincibles who are already through with four wins and just one defeat so far.

De Grandhomme made the decision to bring down the curtain on an impressive international career after discussions this week with New Zealand Cricket - which has agreed to release him from his central contract. The Zimbabwean-born Kiwi said a range of factors had played a part in his decision, not least his struggles with injury and the increasing competition for places in all three formats. \"I accept I'm not getting any younger and that the training is getting harder, particularly with the injuries,\" said De Grandhomme. \"I also have a growing family and am trying to understand what my future looks like post-cricket. All of this has been on my mind over the past few weeks. \"I've been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to play for the Blackcaps since debuting in 2012 and I'm proud of my international career - but I feel this is the right time to finish.\" De Grandhomme departs the international stage with an impressive record, particularly in the Test arena scoring 1,432 runs in 29 matches at an average of 38.70 alongside 49 wickets taken. De Grandhomme said he'd cherished his time playing on the international stage and sharing in such a successful time for New Zealand cricket. \"I've loved being part of this team over the past decade and am grateful for the experiences we've shared together,\" he said. \"I've made many lasting friendships with team-mates, coaching staff and opponents, and will treasure the memories for the rest of my life.\" De Grandhomme said he still retained a desire to play domestic cricket in New Zealand when available, and would be discussing that matter with Northern Districts cricket. New Zealand coach Gary Stead said it was sad to see De Grandhomme depart the international scene, but he understood his reasons. \"Colin's been a hugely influential part of the Blackcaps and contributed to some of the team's greatest achievements,\" he said. \"His immense power with the bat and skills with the ball made him a real match winner and an asset to any side. \"Colin's a great team-man and we will certainly miss his character around the dressing room. \"While it's sad to see him go - we appreciate he's at a stage in his career where he's looking to head in a different direction and we respect that. \"We wish him all the best with his future and hope to see him featuring on the New Zealand domestic scene when available.\"", "the-hundred-matthew-wade-hits-81-as-birmingham-phoenix-pull-off-dramatic-last-ball-victory-over-london-spirit": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Matthew Wade hit a superb 81 runs as Birmingham Phoenix claimed an incredible last-ball victory over London Spirit in The Hundred at Lord's.

Nobody apart from [him and] Ravi Bopara really struck the ball on that wicket all night, goes to show the class of the two international cricketers, it was was exceptional. \"The atmosphere here was very similar to an international game. We played a very first game at The Oval that went down to the wire as well, that was also an international atmosphere.

Not because of the venue, or the access or the talent we were able to play against. It was because of the prize-winners of the competition - Durham's Visually Impaired Cricket Team. Sky VIP had a competition on their platform for a team to win a masterclass at Lord's, where the winners would be able to meet some of the players, partake in drill-based sessions with MCC coaches, and have a mini tour of the Museum and Long Room. Having been put forward by their former coach Louise, the team had been ecstatic when they had heard the news that they would be able to come to the Home of Cricket for two days and also watch Spirit take on Welsh Fire. As I saw them arrive at the Indoor School café at 9am, their smiles and laughs were evident as they settled in for some breakfast. Sky had also brought along audio describers Jenny and Kenny to help enhance the team's experiences and add more information wherever they could. They were handed their VIP bags in which they had a water bottle, a cap, a Lord's sports radio, some bath and body gifts, as well as their very own Hundred jersey. As they brought their equipment along to the Nursery Ground, we were met by four MCC Coaches who started warm-up drills with the team. As I looked at the gear that had been bought along, it was unlike any I had seen before. Another one of their former coaches, Chris, came over to me to explain. \"These are the stumps - they aren't the same as sighted red-ball cricket as they are wider and taller. They are also brightly coloured (usually white or orange) and don't have removable bails as it is safer for us. They are free-standing too.\" He brought over two different cricket balls for me to have a look at. \"We usually play county cricket with a size three football which contains a set amount of tiny carbon balls to produce sound. They allow the fully blind players to hear the noise and hit the ball, judging on the distance. \"The size allows partially sighted players to see the ball. It has to be bowled over-arm, but this small hard ball is played in international cricket and has to be bowled under-arm.\" The MCC coaches, I could tell, were also adapting to the new way they had to train these players. They weren't familiar with having to describe their every movement, and my personal favourite was when one of them declared for the team to \"put their ankle behind to their buttock\" in their exercise routine! I also noticed a mixture of coloured bands on the players' wrists - black, red, purple, yellow and green. When I asked Louise about this, she said it was for coaches/umpires' purposes. \"We have B1 to B4 which are the variant levels of visual impairment or total blindness. Black and purple are for those with no sight; red is for those with high partial sight loss; yellow is for low partial sight loss and green is for the midpoint. They allow coaches and umpires to know the difference in the sight loss for all the players. \"However, some of their sight loss can't be differentiated into bands because some may also have tunnel-vision, where they can't see to their left/right.\" The rules for visually-impaired teams are different to sighted cricket. The blind players have to wear shades and when batting, they have a runner alongside them instead of having to make a sprint themselves. Verbal signs are used by the umpires and players; the bowler must shout \"Play!\" as they release the ball, and the delivery must bounce at least twice if bowled to a completely blind batter (once if bowled to a partially-sighted batter) but must not be rolling. Totally blind batters cannot be out due to being stumped and must be found to be lbw twice before going out - they also get double runs if they hit a boundary. Blind fielders are allowed to take a catch on the bounce. Louise, 36, and Chris, 39, are married and managed the team for three years until coronavirus hit and the Durham Cricket Board took them over. They still partake in training and coaching the team, alongside Bryan, 81. The range of ages in the team is extraordinary yet, as I watched them, they all felt like one big family. Nathan Jameson, who plays professionally for England at the age of 29, believes the same. \"They aren't just my team-mates; they're like my family. It isn't every day that you get to be at Lord's but to be here alongside them is just incredible. With everyone's different sight levels, you just naturally become really close to them.\" When Nathan told me his story of how he was diagnosed, I was in disbelief. His entire life had changed in just 24 hours. \"I used to drive and work. One day, I went to work as usual and just couldn't see the screens. I couldn't read or see anything on the computers at all. I told my manager who sent me home and I went to see many doctors, specialists and Great Ormond Street came to see me. What they said was that it went down as unexplained but basically the wires from my brain to my eyes just didn't work anymore.\" It was an entire life-change. I went from driving to not being able to. I lost friends. But having these guys makes up for it.\" Louise had also bought a Vine Simulation package - a training pack that enables others to understand the difficulties faced by people with sight problems - for us and the MCC coaches to try on. It included 10 pairs of spectacles replicating the different sight loss levels in which one of the coaches, Becks had a go. She was stunned at the difficulty of it all. They all donned the glasses and played some cricket with the bowlers clapping (for the batter's judgement) before they delivered the ball to the coaches. After an incredible lunch, the team were treated to a tour of the Museum in which they were told the great story of the Ashes and handed a mini replica for show. They were also allowed to have a look at some brilliant historical pieces such as Ben Stokes' bat and MS Dhoni's wicketkeeping gloves. Next, they made their way to the Pavilion, where they stood in the Long Room and heard about the many marvels of the ancient ground. Lord's was the only ground where cricketers had to walk through spectators to the pitch and with over 3,000 paintings in their art collection, players were asked when they retired if they wanted their portrait taken to add. With over 18,000 members, there was a waiting list of 29 years, and the protected building wasn't even allowed to get double-glazing, meaning many windows had been broken in their time. The last joy of the day for the team was to play some quick cricket with London Spirit. They were lucky enough to meet the likes of Ravi Bopara, Megan Schutt, captain Charlie Dean, Daniel Bell-Drummond and Mason Crane. The Spirit players donned their simulation spectacles and played some great matches with the Durham team. Having taken many pictures and had a lot of fun, the visually impaired team were still telling me how in awe they were, playing cricket at Lord's. Nathan spoke about wishing for more exposure to their game as many have never known or heard about visually impaired cricket before - me included. Well, we hope we can shed that special light upon the astonishing game for everyone. Finally, having asked Emma, 46, what she would say to those who wish to play cricket but feel they are at a disadvantage, she responded, \"I'd say give it a go! When I first started, I didn't go anywhere by myself and lost a lot of work friends. I didn't have much of a social life. \"When I phoned the cricket club, they said they trained half an hour away and I thought I wouldn't be able to do it because I couldn't expect my mum to take me there and back. \"But straightaway, they really helped my confidence with travelling, because they asked me if I could get to a train station and then they would meet me there. \"There is always ways around the barriers so just go for it!

The Birmingham team's batting collapsed, all out for 75, the lowest score in the men's Hundred so far. With that triumph, the Manchester Originals move into third in the table. Phoenix are fifth. Originals rose to the pressure of a must-win game by totalling 154 for six and then bowling and fielding brilliantly to bowl the home side out for 75. The defeat, in front of a bumper 21,00 crowd, denied Phoenix a win which would have virtually sealed their passage. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Both sides now have it all to play for in their final games, Phoenix are away to London Spirit on Tuesday and Originals face Oval Invincibles at home on Wednesday. Originals chose to bat and only Phil Salt 56 (38 balls) passed 30 against an attack led by Benny Howell (three for 18) and Kane Richardson (two for 27). They had started their innings solidly, reaching 50 from 38 balls for the loss of only Laurie Evans, who skied a slog at Richardson. Salt charged to a 33-ball half-century much to the angst of Henry Brookes, who dropped him at short fine leg on eight and was then lifted for two sixes in three balls as the batter charged straight through the forties to his fifty. The consistent Howell kept a brake on as Wayne Madsen, Tristan Stubbs and Paul Walter all fell flailing against the medium-pacer. All sent up skiers before Salt's assault was ended by an lbw decision for Richardson, the batsman departing in high dudgeon after being told that his call for a review, which would have been upheld, arrived too late. At 113 for five from 82 balls, the Originals needed a late rally and Tom Lammonby supplied it with a meaty 12-ball 26 including four fours and a six. Phoenix's chase started badly, with two wickets in the first four balls taken by spinner Tom Hartley, and never recovered. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Hartley finished with four for 22 as the Phoenix challenge fizzled out after just 74 balls. He struck two immediate hammer blows on the Phoenix chase. From the spinner's second ball, Miles Hammond was caught at extra cover. His fourth bowled skipper Moeen Ali through a slog sweep. Sneed and Chris Benjamin partially rebuilt with a stand of 45 in 31 balls but both fell in the space of three balls. Benjamin was run out by Madsen's direct hit and Smeed hoisted Paul Walter to deep square leg. Hartley returned to remove Brett D'Oliveira, caught in the deep, and bowl Ben Dwarshuis which left the Phoenix in a heap at 63 for seven, doomed to an ignominious defeat and needing to lift themselves very quickly for the vital visit to Spirit on Tuesday. Hero of the Match, Tom Hartley: \"I just tried to use the pitch as much as I could really. \"We saw the Southern Braves do it last year, they lost the first two games. Obviously we lost the first three but we picked up good rhythm and the boys are really getting along so there's no reason why we can't [go all the way].\" Manchester Originals captain, Laurie Evans: \"Huge win. They're must-win games all the way through ever since we lost three out of three. The boys made me look good there with all my bowling changes. They were outstanding. We thought we were a little bit under par maybe initially but it turned out to be a pretty competitive score so pretty chuffed. \"[On Tom Hartley] He's fantastic at doing it and it was so good to see him pick up the rewards of bowling those top overs. \"[On Phil Salt] He played fantastically well. Once again he's shown how good he is and he's been brilliant in this tournament. \"We've enjoyed ourselves throughout this tournament, we've got a great group here. This Hundred is just fantastic.\" Birmingham Phoenix captain, Moeen Ali: \"Obviously if you're going well you can keep going. But if you do lose early wickets [you need] to just sit in the game and hang in there almost. In their innings they ended the game [above] 150 from nowhere really, so it can happen. Just sit in a little and you never know what can happen. We've got some good players and we can win games. \"It was just one of those days when we were poor. But we've played well throughout the tournament. \"We've got to rejig one or two things and hopefully come back strong on Tuesday.\" Trent Rockets and Welsh Fire are next to meet in The Hundred in a Bank Holiday Monday double-header. The Fire finally earned a first win in the women's competition, at the fifth time of asking against Northern Superchargers on Friday, while it is the last chance for the men to get a first win on the board in their final group game.

Birmingham would have guaranteed their passage through to the knockouts with victory in front of their home fans at Edgbaston but, chasing 123 to win, they came up well short, bowled out for 104 off the final ball. The Phoenix chase got off to the worst possible start as the top-order suffered an almighty collapse. England pace bowler Kate Cross (2-14) saw off both openers, Eve Jones for a second-ball duck and skipper Sophie Devine for four. Amy Jones (6) and Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry (5) also fell cheaply, and when England spinner Sophie Ecclestone (3-8) trapped Sophie Molineux lbw for three, the hosts were reeling at 22-5 after 34 balls. Manchester Originals 122-6 from 100 balls - Lamb (30 off 21 balls), Burns (28 off 25 balls); Arlott (2-17 from 20 balls), Gordon (2-20 from 20 balls), Wong (1-13 from 15 balls) Birmingham Phoenix 104 all out from 100 balls - Elwiss (32 off 25 balls), Wong (24 off 26 balls); Ecclestone (3-8 from 20 balls), Cross (2-14 from 20 balls), Jones (2-25 from 20 balls) Georgia Elwiss (32) and Issy Wong (24) briefly rallied the innings with a 46-run stand but Birmingham never truly threatened their target as they slipped to their inevitable defeat, with the superb Ecclestone running through the tail late on.

If you want to be part of the action, go to thehundred.com/tickets Earlier, opener Emma Lamb - who made her England Test and one-day international debuts earlier this summer - top-scored with 30 off 21 balls in the Originals' total of 122-6. Lamb and South African big-hitter Lizelle Lee (20 off 16) shared in a 53-run partnership off just 35 balls that promised a greater score for the visitors, but only Erin Burns (28 off 25) and Ecclestone (20 off 14) really capitalised off the platform provided. It still proved to be more than enough, however, for Manchester to secure their second win of the women's competition. They need a third in their final game, and a few other results to go their way, to earn a play-off spot. Hero of the Match, Sophie Ecclestone: \"A great afternoon. I love contributing to a win.

Zak Crawley - 738 Progress. Not many can have been reassured watching Crawley bat this summer - his average before the Emirates Old Trafford Test was 16.40 in 10 innings - but Michael Atherton was after the England opener ground his way to 17 from 77 balls on the second evening to halt a potential full-blown batting collapse from the home side. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"A brilliantly intelligent innings,\" was how James Anderson described a knock in which Crawley showed he had the stubbornness to go with his stroke-making. It was just a shame that after looking more fluent the following morning he fell to a cracking delivery from South Africa speedster Anrich Norte. A score of 38 won't silence all the doubters but the manner of it may have hushed some of them. Alex Lees - 44 There appears little appetite from within the England camp to switch their openers - managing director Rob Key insisted as much during a third-day chinwag with Sky Sports, saying Crawley and Lees will get a long run at it - but Lees may be starting to sweat. His top score in 18 Test innings remains 67 and his best in three knocks in this series is 35, although it would be harsh to slate him for his score of four at Emirates Old Trafford. He snicked an absolute beauty from Lungi Ngidi behind. These things happen. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Due to England's fine bowling, and South Africa's largely below-par batting, Lees did not get a second opportunity in Manchester. He'll get another at The Kia Oval in September, no doubt, and he may have to start seizing these chances sooner or later with Daniel Bell-Drummond, for one, stating a case in county cricket. Ollie Pope - 523 A quiet game all told for the England No 3, not that it mattered in the end, with the hosts so dominant. Pope struck four boundaries on the second evening before he was done for pace by Nortje, inside-edging onto his stumps. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Either side of that, he was alert in the field. A terrific one-handed catch at short-leg in South Africa's first innings did not lead to a dismissal, with Ollie Robinson overstepping, but a smart take at slip left the Proteas seven down in their second dig as England raced to victory on the third afternoon. Pope will now hope to score heavily next month at The Kia Oval, his home ground and one he absolutely adores. Joe Root - 49, 0-16 Root's game was even quieter than Pope's. His 17 minutes at the crease only marginally longer than his interview with Athers the day before the match. Root let out an audible \"oh no\" as he edged Kagiso Rabada to slip, was pouched by Sarel Erwee after a number of juggles and bagged a third single-digit dismissal in a row. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Obviously there is no need to panic. After batting like a god for the best part of two years, there was always going to be a leaner patch at some point. And it might be no bad thing for England to win without Root starring, something they have found extremely difficult over the last few years. Jonny Bairstow - 749 Bairstow's busy 49 from 63 balls won't go down as one of his best knocks of what has been a quite spellbinding summer, but boy was it important. He strode to the crease with England having tripped to 43-3 in reply to South Africa's 151 all out. By the time he left it, his team were in a much healthier spot. Bairstow played dashingly and Crawley doggedly as they shared a 91-run stand for the fourth wicket to halt some of the momentum the South Africa bowlers had built up. Like Crawley, Bairstow was prised out by the ferocious Nortje but their partnership had laid the foundations for Ben Stokes and Ben Foakes (more on them in a minute) to combine for a match-winning alliance. Ben Stokes - 9.5103, 2-17 & 2-30 Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The days before the Test were all about Stokes and then so was the game itself. A week that began with Stokes revealing he feared he may never play again, following his break from the game last year for mental health reasons and that he continues to take anxiety medication, ended with him celebrating a victory he had inspired with bat, ball and sheer bloody-mindedness. He chipped in with two wickets in South Africa's first innings - one, admittedly, from a filthy long hop - before hitting a sublimely-paced century, a far cry from the skittish cameos he had played earlier in the summer, and sharing a 173-run stand with Foakes. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Stokes was then the chief reason England won on day three. His double strike of the determined Rassie van der Dussen and Keegan Petersen after tea, during a lung-busting 14-over spell, exposed the tail, which James Anderson and Ollie Robinson then ripped through in the space of 31 balls. Stokes' Amazon Prime documentary was released on Friday. 24 hours later, he remained the headliner. Once again, the hero and heartbeat of this England side. Anderson summed it up quite neatly when he said of his skipper, \"he is an absolute machine and leads by example. Imagine if he had a body that actually functioned properly!\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ben Foakes - 9113no, seven catches The theme of Stokes' innings had been his tone-setting cocktail of smart but aggressive batting, and it was mirrored in every way by Foakes at the opposite end as he stunted South Africa's attack on the way to a sublime 113 not out to help give England an unassailable lead. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It marked Foakes' first Test century since his 107 on debut against Sri Lanka four years ago, the 29-year-old later citing the injection of confidence from both Stokes and Brendon McCullum amid his efforts to find some long-sought-after consistency at the crease. For Foakes to maintain his command beyond the dismissal of Stokes proved a key factor in preventing any momentum shift South Africa might have sensed upon breaking the partnership. And behind the stumps, he was clinical and quick-handed in the face of difficult seam movement off the pitch as he finished with seven dismissals. \"How tight he is behind the stumps is a massive plus for us as a team and gives the bowlers confidence,\" said Stokes. \"An amazing game for him and one he should never forget.\" Stuart Broad - 721, 3-37 & 1-24 Others might grab the headlines, but it was Broad who set England on their way on the opening day when he dismissed Dean Elgar and Keegan Petersen to find himself 2-8 at one point. Come Saturday, he claimed the vital wicket of Aiden Markram after having been denied by a no-ball moments earlier. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Much has been said lately about Broad's future in this England Test team, but this week's victory over South Africa served as a reminder of what he still has to offer and how important he remains to be, both with the ball and as a figurehead in McCullum's locker room. Ollie Robinson - 817, 1-48 & 4-43  As far as Test returns go, Ollie Robinson's three days in Manchester could not have gone much better. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Making his first appearance since January's final Ashes Test, he joined James Anderson in wreaking havoc with seam movement on the opening day to put England in complete control, even if he was made to wait for his wicket after an unfortunate no-ball had denied him earlier in the morning. His line was immaculate across the contest, his control unwavering and his speeds as quick and as consistent as we have seen from him in an England shirt. For Stokes to entrust him with the new ball spoke volumes about the starring role many believe he can play in this team. \"He was on the best none-for in the first innings I've ever seen,\" said Stokes. \"He's had some tough times, but he's turned up here and showed the hard work has been worth it. We know we've got a quality, quality bowler on our hands.\" Jack Leach - 611, 1-11 & 0-26  While England's seamers ran riot, Leach probed as a reliable obstruction to any South African attempt to play on the front foot in a bid to get back in the game. In a performance that might well have fallen under the radar, the spinner collected 13 maidens with an economy of 1.74 across the second innings. He also had a glorious, albeit wayward, reverse-sweep for four in his batting cameo alongside Foakes as England cruised towards their declaration. James Anderson - 9DNB, 3-32 & 3-30 Characteristically devastating. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It became something of a waiting game for England on the third and final day as they closed in on new ball territory with Anderson lurking. They got it, they handed it to him, and they let Jimmy begin to close the curtain as he dismantled Simon Harmer's stumps with a beauty to kick-start a swift tail-end collapse. He had started things earlier that morning with a ripper to remove skipper Elgar's off stump. Even now, Anderson never ceases to delight or enamour with his swing artistry, which the visitors simply could not live with. Few can.

A record crowd of 27,448 spectators flocked to Lord's as a good all-round performance saw the Invincibles become the first visiting team to chase down a target at the home of cricket this season, allowing them to inflict the second defeat of the competition on London Spirit. It pushes them into the top three as the men's standings tighten up with competition to make it through to the latter stages intensifying. After Jacks, who hit seven boundaries and a pair of sixes for 54 off of 38 balls, was caught by Jordan Thompson, Rilee Roussouw (24) and Tom Curran (19*) helped see the Invincibles home. Sam Curran starred with three for 16 to reignite Oval Invincibles' hopes in the Hundred as they triumphed by six wickets in their derby clash against London Spirit at Lord's. Curran produced his best figures in the tournament - a miserly display that was matched by his brother Tom, who went wicketless but also conceded only 16 to ensure the home side were restricted to 122 for seven. That never looked a defendable total and Jacks struck a buoyant 54 from 38 balls as Invincibles sealed victory with 14 balls to spare, taking revenge for their three-run loss to Spirit at the start of the competition. The win lifts Invincibles to joint third in the table, with a crucial final game against Manchester Originals to come on Wednesday, while Spirit will still clinch qualification if they beat Birmingham Phoenix a day earlier. Having opted to bat, Spirit made a stuttering start as Ben McDermott swung and missed Peter Hatzoglou's first legitimate Hundred ball to depart without scoring and Josh Inglis heaved Matt Milnes into the hands of deep square leg. Adam Rossington (36 from 22) gave the innings some impetus with successive boundaries off Milnes and then slammed Hatzoglou over the top for a maximum. However, once Sam Curran had trapped Rossington leg before shuffling across, the visitors began to turn the screw and two wickets in as many deliveries from Jacks reduced Spirit to 67 for five. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Milnes held a spectacular flying one-handed catch at point to dismiss Dan Lawrence before Jacks neatly deflected Ravi Bopara's drive onto the stumps to snare the prize scalp of Eoin Morgan, run out for five. Jordan Thompson (27 from 19) threw the bat as he and Bopara staged a mini-recovery with their stand of 43 from 31, but Sam Curran returned to remove both and tight death bowling ensured the Invincibles would chase a modest target. With Jason Roy sidelined by a back strain, Jordan Cox moved up to open, but he was required to play only a supporting role as Jacks immediately set about the Spirit bowling. Mason Crane's first two deliveries both disappeared over the fence - the second of them narrowly evading the clutches of Bopara, who then put down a chance coming in from the boundary when Jacks swept Lawrence. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Although Liam Dawson made the breakthrough with a ball that turned to bowl Cox, it was not enough to stem the flow of runs as Jacks joined forces with Rossouw (24 from 22) in a partnership of 58.

The skipper was at the heart of all Brendon McCullum's side did well as he set the tone at the crease with a clinical century while collecting four wickets across the contest to help the hosts level the series. \"To come back from last week's disappointment at Lord's to put in the performance we have this week, it obviously gives us a lot of confidence back and sets the series up nicely for the last game at the Oval,\" said Stokes. \"We completely forgot about that performance [at Lord's].

He went for 103 after a decisive partnership with Ben Foakes, who also chalked up a long-awaited Test century with 113 not out. \"It was adapting to the pitch more than anything, it was one of those wickets I feel like you couldn't really hit through the line of it,\" said Stokes. \"Still having that positive mindset and intent to score makes everything easier. I've always found starting an innings against reverse swing is always the toughest. \"Because I was looking to go at the ball and be positive it was actually easier.

He meanwhile spared praise for the contributions of Zak Crawley, who dug deep to survive a tough evening session and keep England ticking on day two with a stern knock of 38 amid his own efforts to establish himself as a long-term feature at the top of the order. \"The way in which he [Crawley] applied himself was incredible, especially at the top of the innings to do that against this attack and obviously the way the new ball played on that wicket, it definitely was a new ball wicket,\" said Stokes. \"Even against the older ball, the reverse swing, the way he applied himself, the relentlessness in his decision-making was incredible and he really set me and Foaksey up to go out and play like that. \"I think you're right, I think it might get overlooked and it shouldn't be because that was a real match-defining innings at the top of the order for us.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  South Africa captain Dean Elgar admitted his side were made to pay for a torrid first innings that saw the visitors dismissed for 151, but insisted he had no regrets over the decision to include two spinners or to remove Anrich Nortje from the attack for large periods of the second session on Friday. \"I thought we had a plan coming here knowing it would be a little drier, team selection was bat first and take it on,\" said Elgar. \"First innings are important in Test cricket, trying to set up the game later on and knowing the wicket might crumble like it started showing signs of. \"I don't regret any decisions made prior to the game.

The seamer said: \"Everyone is clear on their role and what the captain and coach expect of them which is a massive help - it takes away the doubt, allows you to focus on your job. \"I have really enjoyed the last few months, the way Ben and Brendon want us to play. My role has become different. I am not a defensive bowler at all anymore. \"They want me to take wickets and think about taking wickets all the time. I think I have smiled more than I ever have on a cricket field. \"[Have I ever been fitter?] Maybe not. I try to look after my body as I love doing this.

The hosts had been stuttering at 43-3, only for under-pressure opener Zak Crawley - who came into the Test averaging below 17 in 10 innings this summer - to compile a gritty 38 from 101 deliveries and Jonny Bairstow a more free-flowing 49 from 63 in a fourth-wicket alliance of 91. Anderson added: \"It was a brilliant [performance]. We spoke a lot after the last game about how we can be better. \"With the ball we stuck to our guns and tried to keep catchers in the whole way through the game. \"With the bat, we spoke about learning when to soak up pressure and then put it back onto the opposition.

James Anderson (3-30), Stuart Broad (1-24) and Ollie Robinson (4-43) were irresistible in the morning as South Africa slipped from their overnight 23-0 to 54-3, before Rassie van Der Dussen (41 off 132) and Keegan Petersen (42 off 159) shared a gritty fourth-wicket stand of 87 from 261 balls. Stokes (2-30) cracked the game open after tea, removing Van der Dussen - braving a finger injury sustained in South Africa's first innings 151 all out - and Petersen in the first and third overs of the session respectively during a herculean and economical 14-over bowling spell ahead of the second new ball, which England then used to wrap up the match in devastating style. Anderson cleaned up Simon Harmer (16) from his second delivery with the fresh Dukes as South Africa went on to lose their final seven wickets for 38 runs and their last five for seven - Anderson's dismissal of Kagiso Rabada (2) taking him to a 100th Test match wicket against South Africa in what was his 100th Test match on home soil. England stormed to an innings win, just over a week after suffering one at Lord's, with the hosts dominating throughout in Manchester, razing South Africa on day one, making 415-9 declared in their sole innings as Stokes hit his 12th Test hundred and Ben Foakes his second, and then dismissing the tourists in 85.1 overs in their second innings. The teams will meet again at The Kia Oval from September 8 in a decider with England holding the momentum but South Africa still targeting a first series win over their opponents, home or away, since 2012. The Proteas could do little to stem an inspired England bowling performance on Saturday morning. Anderson bowled South Africa skipper Dean Elgar (11) off stump with a peach of a delivery; Robinson nicked off Elgar's opening partner Sarel Erwee (25) and Broad then had Aiden Markram (6) caught at slip - having bowled the same man off a marginal no-ball on nought. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Stokes opted to open the bowling with part-time off-spinner Joe Root but the seamers were soon into their work - Anderson castling Elgar in the fourth over with a gorgeous delivery that held its line, one ball after beating the left-hander's outside edge with one that nipped away. Robinson snaffled Erwee from around the wicket - wicketkeeper Foakes collecting a tremendous low grab as he continued his fine Test match - while Zak Crawley was the catcher when Broad finally mopped up Markram. Broad's no-ball that had reprieved Markram in his previous over was the second chalked-off wicket of the morning - Petersen successfully overturning a caught-behind dismissal off Anderson on six with DRS showing ball had missed bat by a considerable distance. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  England went wicketless in the afternoon, due to Van der Dussen and Petersen's doggedness but also a non-review - Van der Dussen would have been out caught behind off Stokes in the penultimate over of the session had the hosts called for DRS, with UltraEdge showing a faint nick. It mattered little with Van der Dussen edging Stokes through to Foakes moments into the evening session and Petersen then fencing a snorter of a ball from the England skipper through to Foakes. Stokes' 14 overs on the reel - six before tea and eight after it - and some equally frugal bowing from Jack Leach kept the scoring rate down, meaning South Africa were still 92 runs in arrears when England took the new ball. The tourists added just seven more runs to their total with Anderson accounting for Harmer and Rabada, and Robinson snaffling Keshav Maharaj (2) and Anrich Nortje (2) before castling Lungi Ngidi (0) to send the England fans at Emirates Old Trafford wild.

The right-arm off-spinner bowled out four opponents in four sets for the concession of just 12 runs, with Shabnim Ismail and Eva Gray also grabbing a pair of wickets each as the hosts were bowled out for just 80 runs. That left an easy target to chase down, which Invincibles did swiftly. Susie Bates went for 31, while fellow opener Lauren Winfield-Hill (44*) and 18-year-old Alice Capsey (6) saw them over the line with 42 balls to spare. A fourth victory in The Hundred means the Invincibles have sealed a place in the top three and are through to at least The Eliminator, sitting two points behind the unbeaten Southern Brave, while Spirit are bottom of the standings with just one win from their five games so far. Spinner Villiers recorded her best bowling figures in the women's Hundred with an impressive four for 12, decimating local rivals London Spirit for just 80, as Oval Invincibles secured their place in the knockout stages. Villers dismissed both opening batters to reduce Spirit to a dismal four for three after just 11 balls. The innings never recovered as the hosts were bowled out after 97 deliveries, making unpleasant history by posting the second lowest total in this year's tournament. Ismail and Gray contributed with two wickets apiece, while Spirit's highest scorer was Amelia Kerr, with a total of 31 off 31. In turn, the Invincibles made light work of the chase and reached their total in just 58 balls, for the loss of Suzie Bates. Top-scorer Winfield-Hill struck an impressive 44 off 28 balls to end Spirit's lingering chances of a play-off spot.

If you want to be part of the action, go to thehundred.com/tickets After electing to field, Villiers wrecked the top order of the Spirit side, taking two wickets in nine balls. Opening batter Danielle Gibson went for a silver duck, trying to take the aerial route after three, and Beth Mooney, leading run-scorer for her side with 201 in four innings, was caught by an incredible diving catch by Capsey. Ismail continued the brutal attack after outing Sophie Luff LBW. The first boundary for the hosts came after an extensive 19 balls and with only eight fours in their entire innings, momentum slowed. Kerr and captain Charlie Dean tried to recover with a partnership of 27 off 33 however Dean stepped out of her crease to Capsey, and Winfield-Hill whipped off the bails for another shock to the system for Spirit. Villiers returned to take two more wickets in four balls, in the form of Naomi Dattani and Grace Scrivens, and the chokehold Spirit were in left them with their innings petering out. In contrast, Winfield-Hill smashed her first delivery by Megan Schutt to the deep third boundary. The opening partnership between Winfield-Hill and Bates destroyed Spirit's bowling - Bates smashed two successive fours and cleared the ropes in three deliveries by Kerr, who conceded 16 runs in her set of five. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  At the end of the powerplay, the visitors had already scored 45 runs for none, in contrast to Spirit's miserable 15 for three. The partnership continued with both Bates and Winfield-Hill causing havoc, scoring 54 off 37 deliveries until the former top-edged Scrivens straight into Mooney's gloves. Capsey provided a firm base as Winfield-Hill continued her ruthless spell, smashing consecutive fours against Dean and scoring a total of seven boundaries in her innings. Winfield-Hill sealed the win for the Invincibles with 42 balls to spare, with Spirit's faint hopes of securing their place in the play-offs completely evaporated.

A high-performance review, chaired by former England captain and director of cricket Sir Andrew Strauss and which Key is part of, has recommended a reduction in the days of domestic cricket and a streamlined top division in the County Championship. The Hundred, currently in its second season, is set to remain part of the calendar until at least 2028 with the tournament held in August during the school holidays. Speaking to Sky Sports Cricket during the second LV= Insurance Test between England and South Africa at Emirates Old Trafford, Key said: \"The Hundred is an integral part of the broadcast deal for one but I actually think it will do so much for our game, it will secure the future of our game. \"It is the best standard of white-ball cricket we have got, the best playing against the best. You want the best players and the best teams going at it over and over again and that's what this does. \"But we can't have people not playing first-class cricket in that window. I don't want players not to be playing any red-ball cricket in that period. It just doesn't work. \"Looking at this [England vs South Africa] series, it would have been better if we had been able to give our Test cricketers some red-ball cricket. \"The general consensus, though, is that we play far too much cricket. If you are a red-ball player only, like Dom Sibley is for example, there is no time to practise and prepare. \"It's all travel-play, travel-play.

Key said: \"What we didn't do was say to them, 'how do you think we can play a cover drive better?' We said, 'how does your system work?' What are the priorities for your sport'. \"Sir Dave Brailsford spoke about the fact it is not just about winning, it's about the style and the way you go about it and carry yourself as a team. \"[England Test captain] Ben Stokes and [coach] Brendon McCullum embody that, Joe Root, and I thought the Trent Bridge win [when England beat New Zealand earlier this summer after a blistering run chase] when you had a full crowd who had come in for free was the way you conduct yourself.

On his 600th appearance in all forms of cricket, 37-year-old Croft's unbeaten 115 was the difference at Blackpool to help Lancashire chase down another 300-plus total to earn victory. A 98-run opening stand between centurion Ben Slater and Sol Budinger (56) helped Nottinghamshire to a total of 338-8 from their 50 overs, putting them in a strong position to progress. But after Croft's heroics, supported by a key seventh-wicket stand with Danny Lamb, Lancashire became the first of the seven sides to chase down a total of 300 or more to do it twice in this year's competition. Lamb came to the crease with the hosts looking a little rocky on 237-6 in the 38th over. He holed out with eight still needed to win off 13 balls, but Croft finished the job with a boundary. \"It's a very nice feeling to be there at the end and get the lads through to the semi-final,\" Croft said. \"White-ball wise, this is going to be up there for me. An unbeaten hundred on your home ground to get through to the semi-finals is something I won't forget.\" Lancashire will play Sussex in the last four. Kent's place in the semi finals against Hampshire never looked in doubt as they dominated Leicestershire at Grace Road.

In reply, Harry Podmore took the first three wickets to reduce Leicestershire to 77-3 before Grant Stewart finished off the tail with 4-42 as the hosts were bowled out for 244 in the 43rd over.

It was Foakes' first Test ton since making 107 on his debut against Sri Lanka in Galle four years ago and the 29-year-old was naturally delighted to play a starring role in a home Test. \"It was a bit of relief and I was overjoyed getting a Test hundred,\" Foakes told Sky Sports. \"I've had a bit of a wait and I realised how hard they are to come by, so I think I celebrated this one a bit more. \"It's obviously a great opportunity playing for England and you want to contribute as much as possible.

It was the day his candid documentary Phoenix from the Ashes was released, a film in which he goes into granular detail about the difficulties he has faced over recent years. From the Bristol incident to the death of his father. Suffering debilitating panic attacks. Taking anxiety medication. But he also had a big job to do on the field against South Africa after striding to the crease with his side still four runs behind and five wickets down after Proteas paceman Anrich Nortje had dismissed Zak Crawley and Jonny Bairstow caught behind during a searing five-over spell. It was a job he performed to perfection as he and fellow centurion Ben Foakes helped England carve out a first-innings advantage of 264. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There seemed a chance Stokes' knock would be over shortly after it had begun when an apparent twinge of the knee - a joint that has been giving him gip all summer - left him grimacing. Treatment did the trick, though, and he carried on with an innings in which South Africa's bowlers occasionally got the treatment. There were nine boundaries in Stokes' 103 from 163 balls - six fours and three sixes. So, yes, it was an innings of belligerence at times but beauty, too, And brains. A perfect balance of attack and defence. It was the sort of innings we have seen Stokes play numerous times over the years, just not this summer. The consensus has been that Stokes has been too frenetic of late, too eager to lead from the front and get this forward-thinking England side ahead of the game by sacrificing himself. Kevin Pietersen even said Stokes was \"devaluing his wicket\" after one febrile cameo against India. But this was different. The intent was there - see sixes over the leg-side off Simon Harmer and a gorgeous straight four off Lungi Ngidi after skipping down the pitch. There was no timidity. But there was a patience. A willingness to get himself in before getting on with it. Stokes took 101 deliveries to reach his half-century - the milestone clinched with one of the sixes off Harmer - but then just a further 57 to reach three figures. His strike rate for the innings was 63.19. Game-advancing but also example-setting. Sky Sports Cricket expert Kumar Sangakkara said: \"It was an incredible innings, not just in the context of the game but in the context of the messaging around how this team should be playing in this new culture. \"I spoke to Brendon McCullum this morning and he was very bullish about being positive but not reckless and it was a great example by the captain, the leader of setting the tone. \"He mixed aggression with smartness.

There has been conversation about his batting, which has sometimes gone too far to the aggressive side, but I thought he played in a really controlled fashion. \"Earlier in the summer, he perhaps didn't get that right or wanted to say to the team, 'this is how we are going to play'. But when he came down the pitch here, it was controlled. He wasn't coming down to have a big wahoo. \"There was certainty and calmness, a better tempo to his game. He soaked up the pressure and then moved through the gears.\" Stokes, speaking to Sky Sports on Saturday morning, said: \"We have been vocal with how we want to play and me being captain and leader of that, it was more showing lads it was okay to go out and do certain things. \"I am a massive believer in leadership showing that and not expecting anyone else to do something you wouldn't do. \"We got an understanding of the wicket. It didn't feel like a wicket where you could stand there and hit through the line. Some balls were bouncing, some balls were skidding, there was reverse swing. \"But when we do have that positive mindset to score it makes things a lot easier.

Strauss added: \"From an England perspective the proposals look at how we could evolve central contracts to offer more security to our high-profile players and better reflect the changing dynamics in the world game.\" Also among the recommendations is a proposed move for the domestic 50-over competition - currently played at the same time as The Hundred - to the start of the season, \"with a smaller group stage and emphasis on knockouts\".

The 'Mankad' - where a bowler runs out the non-striking batter in their delivery stride if that batter is backing up - is now deemed a legitimate mode of dismissal. India's women's team recently used the law change in their favour, when bowler Deepti Sharma ran out non-striker Charlie Dean at Lord's in the final ODI of the three-match series. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sharma took the bails off after entering her delivery stride, with the dismissal upheld by the third umpire, securing India a 3-0 series win against England. Dean was in tears after the wicket, with India receiving criticism for the manner of the dismissal. Sharma defended the dismissal after the match, saying that India had warned Dean about leaving her crease, and it is \"as per the rules and guidelines\", but injured England captain Heather Knight accused India of lying, saying on Twitter that \"no warnings were given\" to Dean. Reacting after the match on Sky Sports Cricket, Michael Atherton said it is up to the non-striker to \"stay in your ground until the ball is released\". \"I always find it odd when 'Mankads' happen. It's historically associated with something underhand, but whenever it happens, the focus always falls on the fielding side and the bowler as if they've done something wrong. \"A 'Mankad' cannot happen if the non-striker stays in their ground. And that's where the onus falls. \"The message is clear really: If you're a non-striker at the non-striker's end, you stay in your ground until you see the ball released, and this thing can never happen. \"The debate will never happen, and all the outpouring of emotion on social media can't happen. It's simple, stay in your ground. \"The law is absolutely clear.\" Lydia Greenway said that, while it is within the rules, it doesn't \"feel like the right way to win a game\". \"The way in which it's managed I would disagree with. If I was captain of that team, I would say lets give them a warning, and then make sure that Charlie Dean is aware of what she's doing. \"Because as youngsters growing up playing the game, you're taught to back-up, and if you look at Charlie Dean backing up, she was just focussed on what was happening at the other end. \"I don't think she was trying to gain an unfair advantage. \"She was just simply focussing on what was in hand. She was just looking at what's happening, literally turned around and Deepti Sharma has decided to do that, which, we must say, she is allowed to do.\" This manner of dismissal has been heavily criticised by some for being against the spirit of the game, and it was previously under the unfair play section of the law. However, it is now classed as a legitimate run out. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In other changes that come into force, using saliva to shine the ball will be banned and considered tampering. The use of saliva was prohibited following the outbreak of Covid-19 and research by the sport's lawmakers found this \"had little or no impact on the amount of swing the bowlers were getting\", with players using sweat to polish the ball, which was equally effective. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  This law change around using saliva to shine the ball has been made permanent. Annoucing the law change earlier this year, the MCC said it \"removes any grey areas of fielders eating sugary sweets to alter their saliva to apply to the ball,\" with its use treated the same way as \"any other unfair methods of changing the condition of the ball\".

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The law around judging a wide has been amended, given batters are now moving laterally around the crease more before the ball is bowled. There are also several changes to the 'dead ball law', the most significant of which is if either side is disadvantaged by a person, such as a pitch invader, an animal or other object within the field of play which has a material impact on the game.

Sweden's Joakim Lagergren also shot 68 to finish six shots behind, with Australia's Min Woo Lee another three strokes back in third. Otaegui was one of three players added to the field for July's Genesis Scottish Open after appealing against their suspensions for playing in the inaugural LIV event in Hertfordshire.

The hearing is scheduled for February. Otaegui played three of the first four LIV events but it is not clear if he will play any further tournaments.

The 42-year-old withdrew from the DP World Tour's flagship event at Wentworth in September following an opening 76, but didn't give officials a reason and was seen in social media posts attending a college American football game in Texas two days later. Players can withdraw from events for emergency reasons or medical circumstances, but Garcia failed to provide written evidence of any medical reason within the 21-day period and has subsequently been fined an undisclosed amount. The BMW PGA Championship counts as one of the events Garcia needs to play to remain a DP World Tour member, but the former Masters champion remained one short of the required four this season. The Spaniard failed to enter next week's Mallorca Golf Open, and although he could receive an invitation to that event or the Nedbank Golf Challenge in November, that appears unlikely. Only DP World Tour members can be selected for the Ryder Cup, meaning that the contest's record points scorer could have made his last appearance for Team Europe.

Woods is a notable absentee from this week's field at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club, the venue where he equalled Sam Snead's record for most PGA Tour wins by claiming a three-shot victory and 82nd title in the 2019 contest. The former world No 1's victory followed a 15th major title at The Masters earlier in the year, although injuries and a career-threatening car crash have left Woods playing a limited schedule in the seasons since his last success. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Woods' appearance in the 2019 tournament was his first worldwide start since undergoing knee surgery at the end of the previous campaign, with the American recovering from bogeying his first three holes of the week to card a six-under 64 and grab a share of the early lead. Heavy rain saw Friday's action wiped out and the second round take place without spectators, Woods birdieing his final two holes to open up a two-shot advantage at the halfway stage. The lead increased to three strokes after a four-under 66, with Woods retaining the same cushion over the field when he returned on Monday morning to play his final seven holes. Hideki Matsuyama briefly got within two of the lead after Woods bogeyed the 12th, only for the former world No 1 to pick up a shot the 14th and sign off his wire-to-wire win with a final-hole birdie. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Woods hasn't featured in a regular PGA Tour event since the 2020 Zozo Championship, held in California due to Covid-19 travel restrictions, where he finished tied-72nd as Patrick Cantlay claimed a one-shot victory. The five-time Masters champion competed at Augusta National the following month, with the traditional opening men's major of the year switched to November because of the pandemic, then underwent back surgery after the PNC Championship ahead of the new season. Woods suffered severe leg and ankle injuries in a car crash in February 2021, ruling him out of all the majors that season, with a return to the PNC Championship alongside his son Charlie in the December of that year his only other competitive appearance. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A 47th-placed finish in a long-awaited return to action at The Masters was one of only three official events played so far in 2022, with Woods making a mid-tournament withdrawal from the PGA Championship and then skipping the US Open ahead of his appearance in The 150th Open. Woods arrived at St Andrews looking to create more major history, at the venue where he had already lifted the Claret Jug twice, only to fail to progress beyond 36 holes for just the fourth time in his long Open career. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Woods told reporters after his missed cut at The Open he had \"nothing planned\" when discussing his future schedule, adding that it may be \"sometime next year\" before he competes again. It would be a surprise not to see Woods at the Hero World Challenge in December, a limited-field event in the Bahamas supporting his charities, although his name was not listed in the initial 17 players confirmed to be teeing it up from December 1-4. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Woods can still take one of the three vacant slots in the at 20-player line-up, while he is also likely to feature alongside his son Charlie from December 17-18 in the two-day PNC Championship. \"I'm hoping that he will play maybe in December at the Hero [World Challenge] and the Father-Son [PNC Championship] and maybe the Genesis [Invitational],\" caddie Joe LaCava told the Dan Patrick Show earlier in the summer. \"I'm still hoping he'll play three, maybe four tournaments before The Masters.\" Sky Sports' Wayne Riley expects to see Woods tee it up in at least one PGA Tour event before he heads to Augusta National, although warns it may not be until 2023 until we see him play tournament golf. \"The way I feel, I think it will be Florida Swing,\" Riley said. \"Maybe we'll see him at the Honda Classic, as that's where he lives. Maybe we'll see him at Arnold Palmer Invitational or The Players. He'll play before he plays The Masters, but he'll have time out now as well.\" Watch the Zozo Championship throughout the week live on Sky Sports.

The group has become a signatory to the United Nations Sports for Climate Action Framework and the Framework's Race to Zero pledge, which requires all signatories to commit to reduce direct emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2040. The Sports for Climate Action Framework was created by the United Nations and made for sports organisations and their stakeholders to tackle climate change through a set of five principles. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Those principles are: Undertaking systematic efforts to promote greater environmental sustainability, reducing overall climate impact, educating for climate action, promoting sustainable and responsible consumption, as well advocating for climate action through communication. It will be a key focus of Golf for Good, the European Tour group's commitment to Driving Golf Further in an environmentally and socially sustainable way, ensuring the Tour has a positive long-term impact on the courses, countries and the communities it visits. Keith Pelley, chief executive of the European Tour group, said: \"The group's DP World Tour is a global brand with millions of followers, so we have a clear responsibility and opportunity to use our platforms in the right way. \"Our net zero commitment shows that through Golf for Good we are serious about environmental responsibility and the role we can play. \"Our staff and leadership, under the guidance of our Head of Sustainability, are determined to ensure we fully meet all our pledges, and we appreciate the support of our expert partners and advisers in helping us do so. Of course, we also invite our partners and stakeholders to join us in making effective change.\" Becoming a signatory to the United Nations Sports for Climate Action Framework is the logical next step in the Tour's Green Drive initiative, which has grown in scale and impact over several years and was re-launched on World Environment Day last year. The most recent Sustainability Strategy further aligns Green Drive with the Tour's wider Golf for Good programme to create a new, holistic approach to sustainable development - on and through the Tour.

Englishwoman Hull - whose sole LPGA Tour triumph to date came in Florida in November 2016 - fired eight birdies during a seven-under-par second round to carve out a two-stroke advantage over the field. The 26-year-old found it tougher going on Saturday, with a double-bogey six at the start of her back nine seeing her drop two shots behind Chinese player Xiyu Lin at the top of the leaderboard. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  However, Hull birdied 15 and Lin bogeyed 16 meaning there is nothing separating the players heading into the final round, with the duo at 11 under and one clear of Celine Boutier and Lydia Ko. Hull's lengthy birdie putt on the 18th came close to dropping but she had to settle for an even-par round of 71, while Lin carded a two-under 69. Hull said: \"I'm just going to carry on being patient the way I have been the last couple of days and have fun. Hopefully more putts drop [on Sunday].\" Ko bounced back from a double bogey at the 11th with four birdies across her next six holes before parring the 18th for a four-under 67 - a score bettered by Boutier as she shot a five-under 66. Atthaya Thitikul is three shots off the pace on eight under as she aims to win back-to-back tournaments and become World No 1. Thailand player Thitikul triumphed in Arkansas last week and will leapfrog Jin Young Ko at the top of the rankings if she wins this event. Thitikul made three bogeys across four holes on her front nine in a poor start but then recovered with birdies at eight and 13 to end the day just one shot worse off than how she started it. England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff is on two under after a third-round 70, while compatriot Georgia Hall is 11 shots behind the leaders on even par after a three-over 74.

Players have teed up on rotation at Carnoustie, the Old Course at St Andrews and Kingsbarns this week ahead of a 54-hole cut, with the final 18 holes to be contested at St Andrews on Sunday. Mansell will head to the famous venue as the man to catch on 15 under after carding six birdies and a solitary bogey at Carnoustie on Saturday. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Englishman's nearest challengers are countryman Daniel Gavins, New Zealand's Ryan Fox and Sweden's Alex Noren on 11 under - Gavins birdieing two of his final three holes at Kingsbarns and Fox carding a seven-under round at the same venue. South Africa's Oliver Bekker was also on 11 under when he headed to the 18th tee at Kingsbarns - only to then suffer a nightmare quadruple bogey to tumble back to seven under for the tournament. That wrecked a fine round from Bekker with the South African previously carding six birdies and an eagle, but he had to settle for a three-under 69. Mansell, who has three top-five finishes this year, said: \"I played really, really good. My coach, Mike Kanski, has helped massively and I feel really in control of my golf game right now, in control of my golf ball. \"I've been in contention a lot this year and had chances on Sundays. They say in golf that you don't lose, you learn. That's what I feel like I've done really well this year. \"There's a lot of golf left. It's links golf, anything can happen. It's St Andrews.

The World No 2 bogeyed his first hole at the Old Course on Saturday but that was the only blemish of his day, with seven birdies propelling him to a six-under round of 66. McIlroy told Sky Sports: \"The rain yesterday softened the course up so even though it was windy out there the ball was stopping roughly where it landed and that made it quite scoreable.

The pair go into Saturday's third round on 10 under-par - one shot clear of Austria's Sepp Straka. Detry shot a second successive 67 to lead for most of the round but was caught late in the day when Hughes rounded off a brilliant 63. Americans Scott Stallings and Mark Huibbard, plus Garrick Higgo of South Africa, are on eight under. Davies Riley went into Friday in the lead and finished the day one under par with 72, three shots behind Detry and Hughes in seventh place.

Hull seized control with four birdies in a six-hole stretch around the turn and led by two shots over Xiyu Janet Lin (68) and Atthaya Thitikul of Thailand, whose eagle-birdie finish gave her a 67. Thitikul can go to No 1 in the women's world ranking by winning for the second straight week on the LPGA Tour. They played in the morning and caught the better side of the wave at Old American Golf Club with moderate wind. The course remained bouncy, however, making it difficult to take on the pins. The 26-year-old from England managed just fine and relied on her putting. That's what she least likes to practice at home, instead preferring to improve through playing as many as 36 holes a day. \"I just feel like the putter was very strong today,\" Hull said. \"When I was home I was working quite hard on my putting because I felt like that's the boringest part of the game to practice. I don't practice it as much as I should, so I've been doing like two hours each day and just trying to fix it.\" She started on the back nine and with a birdie on the par-five 17th, that sent her on her way to three birdies on the opening four holes of the front nine. Hull finished with two birdies and was at 11-under 131. \"I actually can't really remember much of my round because I was so focused. I didn't know what my score was when I was coming in,\" Hull said. A five-time Solheim Cup player, Hull is nearly six years removed from her lone LPGA Tour win at the CME Group Championship. She also has three Ladies European Tour wins, the most recent last Autumn in the Aramco Team Series in New York. Thitikul won last week in Arkansas, and at age 19 can replace Jin Young Ko at No 1 in the world by winning. She likely will be no worse than No 2 after this week if she finishes ahead of Nelly Korda, who opened with a 75. Korda played in the afternoon and her first order of business was to make the cut. Thitikul has made no secret that Old American doesn't suit her game. She told her team around her at the start of the week she didn't have many expectations. That could be what's helping the Thai teen, who is trying to think less and react to shots. She overcame a double bogey on the par-four ninth hole and put herself in a great position for the weekend with a 40-foot eagle putt on the 17th and a closing birdie. \"When I started, like before first round, I just told myself and my manager, my caddie, that make the cut is good enough for me here on this course,\" Thitikul said. \"It's challenging for me. I think it's so different from last week. It's dry and it's run-out pretty much, and it's so many bunkers. \"I don't think too much on the course. That's why I can play well these two days.\" Lin led by one after the first round and birdied two of the par fives. Lindy Duncan had a 65 and was three shots behind. Lexi Thompson also played in the morning and could only manage a 70, leaving her six shots behind as the American tries to end more than three years without winning on the LPGA.

The second round was brought forward and played under a shotgun start due to heavy rain and strong winds along the Scottish coast, with just nine of the 168-man field able to post an under-par total on any of three courses being used for the event. Mansell posted the lowest round of the day and jumped into a two-shot advantage after a brilliant four-under 68 on the Old Course at St Andrews, mixing five birdies with a lone bogey to move to 10 under, with Noren in second after a brilliant second-round 69 at Kingsbarns. Beginning on the sixth hole, Mansell birdied three of his opening five holes and added another from 20 feet at the 12th, before carding his lone bogey of the day when he failed to get up and down from the greenside bunker at the par-four 16th. The Englishman holed clutch par-saves in worsening weather to save back-to-back pars from the third before signing off with a birdie at the par-five fifth to double his cushion over Noren. \"I thought you've just got to trust that you can actually play golf because you can't feel your hands,\" Noren said. \"You can't do anything.

Just a few hours earlier, the International Team had pulled off a shocking comeback by winning the two-day session on Saturday for the first time since 1998, the last time they won in this series. Attempting to stave off any lingering aftereffects from the day before, Love brought in his team statisticians to put the Americans back in the right frame of mind. \"Our stats guys came up with some incredible stuff this morning about how their team played, especially against a couple of our teams,\" Love said later that day. \"We kept running the same guys out there against their best team. Even though some guys' records don't show it, everybody on this team played incredibly well. It was a great team effort.\" Whatever information the USA's statisticians pulled, it seemed to work. The United States eventually prevailed in the Sunday singles after weathering yet another International surge, claiming a 17.5-12.5 victory for their ninth straight victory in the biennial event. \"We were in a tough spot on Friday, and we showed a lot of guts to fight back,\" International Team captain Trevor Immelman said. \"At some point, I don't know about you guys, but at some point this afternoon, I thought there was still a chance.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Immelman is not off base. As matches began to wind down on Sunday evening, the International Team was very much in the thick of it, thanks in part to victories by Si Woo Kim and Sebastián Muñoz over PGA Tour stars Justin Thomas and Scottie Scheffler, respectively. But this was ultimately Team USA's day. The five-point margin was the second largest in the 30-point iteration of the event, with the USA improving to 10-0-1 over the last 12 cups and 12-1-1 all-time since 1994. They also moved to 8-0 on American soil. Early momentum helped the cause. The Americans built an 8-2 advantage over the first two days, and it looked like they might cross 20 points for the first time since the Presidents Cup went to a 30-point event seven years ago. The United States were either tied or leading after six holes in each of the first 10 matches. \"It's easier to play with a lead,\" Jordan Spieth said. \"You have momentum, especially with a home crowd. Sometimes it's a little harder to come back when you're on the road and you're down.\" It was Spieth at the centre of much of that early momentum, as the 29-year-old carded the best Presidents Cup performance of his career, going 5-0-0 while registering his first Singles win in any international team event. The 13-time PGA Tour winner capped his week with a 4&3 triumph over Australia's Cam Davis, mercifully ending a dubious 0-6-1 record in singles across seven Presidents Cups and Ryder Cups. He did so despite opening with consecutive bogeys, as he rallied with birdies on five of his final 12 holes to coast to the win. \"I thought that I played some of my best golf of the year this week, which was really cool to do on a team with these guys,\" said Spieth, only the sixth player in Presidents Cup history to go 5-0-0. \"Me and Justin (Thomas) had just an unbelievable time in the team setting, and I was glad to finally get in the winner's circle in a singles match for my first time ever.\" An \"unbelievable time\" is certainly one way to describe his pairing with Thomas - the duo played 64 holes together over the first two days and trailed after only two of them. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The pair capped their time together on Saturday with a massive 4&3 victory in fourballs over Hideki Matsuyama and Taylor Pendrith, giving the Americans a bit more comfortable 11-7 lead heading into the final day. They became just the third pairing to go 4-0-0 in a single Presidents Cup, after Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker did it in 2009 and Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace matched them in 2015. And their domination came at a critical point for the USA, who saw Scottie Scheffler become just the second World No 1 to not win a Presidents Cup match (Nick Price also did it in 1994). Though the United States left Quail Hollow with the Presidents Cup, the International Team can still take solace in their hard-fought effort, which lifted several of their players into PGA Tour relevance. None made quite the impression that young Tom Kim did, as the youngest Presidents Cup player ever went 2-3, including a crucial victory in Saturday Fourballs over Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay where he poured in the winning birdie at the 18th, inciting a joyous celebration on the green. \"He's just wired different,\" Immelman said of the 20-year-old, who also notched a foursomes win with K.H. Lee over Scheffler and Sam Burns. \"For him to stripe a two-iron in there and make that putt, man, that shows some guts. I've been in a few moments like that in my career. There's some turmoil going on inside in those moments. You're excited, you're anxious, you're nervous. You got some belief in there. Like there is a lot going on, man. And he pulled it off. We were damn proud of him.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Kim was part of a record four Koreans to make this year's Cup. The group proved to be the heartbeat of the Internationals, going 9-7-1 while the other eight team members went just 6-19-3. Kim would go on to lose 1up in Sunday singles to the USA team's own breakout star, Max Homa, one of only four rookies to go 4-0-0 or better in their Presidents Cup debut. David Duval and Stewart Cink did it in 1996 and 2000, respectively, while Shigeki Maruyama went 5-0-0 for the Internationals in 1998. \"To be here was one thing, and then to come out and play some great golf was another,\" Homa said. \"And this week has been beyond special, validating, meaningful, all of the above.

The Italian overturned a five-stroke deficit during a thrilling final round at Le Golf National, firing nine birdies in a round-of-the-day 62 to register a third DP World Tour title and first since 2019. Migliozzi was one of only two players on the final day to birdie the par-four last, with that incredible finish seeing him end the week on 16 under and a shot clear of closest challenger Rasmus Hojgaard.

Hojgaard started with a one-shot lead and played the par-three second some six shots better than the previous day, rolling in from 55 feet for birdie having made a quintuple-bogey in the third round. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Dane then chipped in for eagle at the par-five next to briefly go three ahead, a day from bogeying the hole, only to three-putt from inside 10 feet at the eighth and bogey the ninth to find himself level with Coetzee at the turn. Hojgaard opened his back nine with a birdie to edge back ahead, although Coetzee moved back alongside him on 14 under following a front-nine 34 by rolling in from 20 feet at the par-three 11th. Migliozzi began on seven under but charged up the leaderboard with five consecutive birdies from the sixth, including one from 35 feet at the seventh, with a run of three more birdies from the 13th briefly jumping him into the solo lead. Coetzee and Hojgaard both took advantage of the par-five 14th to make it a trip tied at the top, where a brilliant approach from Pieters set up a six-foot eagle to move him within one. Pieters found water with his approach into the par-four next on his way to a double-bogey, with Coetzee all falling three behind after putting two balls into the hazard and carding a triple-bogey seven, as Hojgaard two-putted for par to remain alongside Migliozzi on 15 under. Migliozzi followed back-to-back pars over his next two holes with a stunning approach over water into the par-four 18th, resulting in a six-foot birdie to regain the solo lead, which ended up being enough for victory when Hojgaard failed to find a chip-in birdie to extend the contest. \"An explosion of feeling - it has been an incredible day,\" Migliozzi said. \"I love to battle on the golf course and today I received something back. It was a beautiful day of golf.\" Barjon, Pieters and Coetzee all bogeyed the par-four last to end the week on 11 under, while Donaldson joined Migliozzi in making a closing birdie to card a two-under 69 and move a big step closer to securing his DP World Tour card for next season.

The United States, chasing a ninth consecutive victory in the biennial contest and leading 4-1 after the opening-day foursomes, won two and halved two of the five matches on Friday afternoon to build an 8-2 advantage over their inexperienced opponents. Justin Thomas became the first player in Presidents Cup history to win his opening five fourballs matches after partnering Jordan Spieth to a 2&1 victory over Adam Scott and Cam Davis, before Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele defeated Tom Kim and Hideki Matsuyama 3&2. Scottie Scheffler and Sam Burns squandered a lead for the second successive day to claim a share of the spoils against Sungjae Im and Sebastian Munoz, with the other two matches also requiring all 18 holes to produce a result. Rookies Mito Pereira and Christiaan Bezuidenhout halved their match against Kevin Kisner and Cameron Young, although the visitors fell further behind when Max Homa and Billy Horschel claimed a final-hole win over Corey Conners and Taylor Pendrith in the last match on the course. The six-point lead matches the same advantage Team USA held after two days of the 2017 contest at Liberty National, with the overwhelming pre-tournament favourites now requiring just 7.5 points over the final two days to continue their dominant winning Presidents Cup record. Thomas won back-to-back holes with birdies from the fourth and Spieth picked up another after holing from close-range at the eighth, only for Scott to claim the ninth and reduce the deficit to two at the turn. A near hole-in-one from Thomas at the par-three 14th restored Team USA's three-hole cushion and, despite a birdie from Davis at the par-five 16th, Spieth secured the first point of the day with a 20-foot birdie on the penultimate hole. Schauffele holed from 30 feet on both the third and fifth before Cantlay made back-to-back birdies from the seventh, with Schauffele adding another close-range birdie at the eighth to move five ahead. Kim reduced the deficit by winning the 12th with a birdie but fell back five behind when Cantlay rolled in from long range at the next, with the Korean extending the contest with successive birdies from the 14th before eventually losing on the par-five 16th. \"I think hot starts are really big to match play to get the momentum on your side and force opponents to do something to catch back up,\" Cantlay said. \"I think getting out to a lead in match play is huge, and we did a great job of that today.\" A session clean sweep looked a possibility when Scheffler and Burns - who made an 80-foot eagle at the seventh - were two ahead with six holes to play, only for Munoz to birdie the 13th and 17th to level the contest.

Hopes of a first full point of the day for the International Team were increased when Conners followed a birdie at the 11th by holing from 30 feet at the 13th, levelling the final match, only for Homa to make a 15-foot birdie at the 17th and match Pendrith's putt at the last to snatch another USA victory.

The United States have dominated the biennial competition, winning the last eight editions and only losing one of the 13 previous contests, with Davis Love III's team quickly taking control of this year's event during the Thursday foursomes at Quail Hollow Club. A star-studded American line-up won the first three matches on the course against a depleted International Team, containing eight rookies and lacking experience due to several high-profile departures to LIV Golf, with the hosts briefly threatening to complete a clean sweep of the session. Si Woo Kim and Cam Davis produced a remarkable fightback to stun world No 1 Scottie Scheffler and Sam Burns, although that was the only point won for the International Team after Taylor Pendrith and Mito Pereira suffered a final-hole loss in the remaining match on the course. \"We had some matches where we rolling and the guys played great and some matches where we ground it out,\" USA captain Davis Love III said. \"A great start, a lot of heart, but they're going to practice and get ready for the next session tomorrow.\" Trevor Immelman's decision to send out experienced pair Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama - the only two players in the International Team with multiple Presidents Cup appearances - in the opening match backfired, as they were thrashed 6&5 by Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele. The American pair never trailed and only lost one hole during an impressive victory, winning the first four holes of their back nine to continue their 100 per cent foursomes record when playing together for Team USA. Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth made three birdies in a four-hole stretch on their front nine, only for Sungjae Im - the top-scorer for the International Team in their 2019 loss, to make a 10-foot eagle at the seventh and birdie the ninth to reduce the lead for him and Corey Conners to one at the turn. Momentum in that match swung Team USA's way when Thomas holed a 25-foot putt to save par at the 15th, which was enough to win the hole when Conners missed from eight feet, with pars over the next two holes enough for a 2&1 victory. Cameron Young marked his Presidents Cup debut by holing from 25 feet on the penultimate hole for a winning birdie to give him and Collin Morikawa a 2&1 win over Tom Kim and K.H Lee in the third match, with that point guaranteeing Team USA would lead after the opening day. Scheffler and Burns looked set to deliver more success after moving three ahead after just seven holes and remained two up with four to play, only for a three-putt double-bogey at the par-four 15th paving the way for a late International Team recovery. Davis nudged in for a winning par and Kim levelled the contest with a 10-foot birdie at the next, with a close-range birdie at the 17th and kick-in par at the last completing a four-hole winning streak and 2up victory for the visitors. The final match also went to the par-four last, where a two-putt par from Tony Finau and Max Homa was enough for a narrow victory when Pereira hit a wayward final drive and then Pendrith failed to save par from 10 feet. \"We hung in there,\" Immelman said. \"We got off to a real tough start and were behind the eight ball early. The Americans played some brilliant golf and I think we're going to have to find a way of making some putts over the next few days. We'll hang in there and keep fighting - that's what we do.\" Five matches of fourballs take place on Friday, with four more matches of both formats being played across two sessions on Saturday.

It was the brainchild of Tim Finchem, back when he was a deputy for PGA Tour Commissioner Deane Beman. But when Beman handed the reins over to Finchem early in the summer of 1994, going full throttle on the debut of the Presidents Cup consumed him. The naysayers were lined up, but Finchem was steadfast in his belief that great players from beyond the borders of America and Europe deserved to compete on a global stage in an international team match. Should you point to the lopsided results - the Americans are 11-1-1 and have won eight in a row - you would be terrible point-misser. The Presidents Cup was about bringing the game a little closer together because global golf, Finchem insisted, was here to stay. He knew it would be a somewhat awkward fit at first, but he begged for patience and offered a vision that a lot of folks struggled with. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  To wit, there would be a day when the world's best players competed in the same tournaments dozens of time per year and American golf fans would know the international stars quite well. If he were the type to seek the limelight, Finchem could take a bow. But instead, let's take a measurement to indicate how his vision has played out beautifully. In 1994, half the International Team needed to introduce themselves to their American counterparts at the Robert Trent Jones Club in Gainesville, Virginia. Aussie Bradley Hughes had only played in six PGA Tour tournaments that season, while Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe (five), Peter Senior (three) of Australia, and Frank Nobilo (two) attended even fewer. As for Robert Allenby of Australia and Tsukasa Watanabe of Japan, they hadn't played at all. In all, the 12 International Team members had combined for just 141 PGA Tour tournaments in 1994, which is not an indictment of them whatsoever. It is a reminder of the era, when global traffic was limited to the world's very elite names and, while the Presidents Cup perhaps appealed back then to those who are intrigued by players they know little about, Finchem was convinced the stature of the competition would grow as American fans became educated about the Aussies and South Africans, the South Americans and the Canadians. \"In 20 years,\" Finchem told reporters back then, \"we can have an event of really premier quality.\" Critique Finchem's statement as much as you'd like, there is an argument to be made that he's been proven correct. Three of the past five competitions have been close, with a 16-14 scoreline in Australia in 2019, a one-point match in South Korea in 2015; a closer-than-it-looks 18.5-15.5 decision at Muirfield Village in 2013. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Then there is the familiarity aspect. Whereas 28 years ago the 12-man International Team combined for just 141 PGA Tour starts, in 2021-22 the 12 members of this year's Presidents Cup team totaled 282 starts. That is a growth of 100 per cent, and the difference can be seen up and down the lineup. Eleven of the 12 members of this year's International Team made 20-plus PGA Tour starts this year, while Tom Kim appeared in 11 events as he eventually earned his card by the end of the season-while seven of them made 25 starts or more. Budding stars from Chile (Mito Pereira, 27 starts) and South Korea (K.H. Lee, 28) head the list of workhorses, while Lee's fellow countryman - Si Woo Kim - will join him in Charlotte for his second Presidents Cup after a team-leading 29 starts this season. Corey Conners made his first team after a year of admirable consistency, as did fellow Canadian Taylor Pendirth (21 starts). Aussie Cam Davis (25), South African Christiaan Bezuidenhout (24), Sebastian Muñoz (25) and Hideki Matsuyama (21) also help comprise the roster. Round out the team with South Korean Sungjae Im, who with \"only\" 26 starts this season is almost slacking off, and you have an International Team that is getting more and more comfortable in the United States by the week. That, in turn, is why optimism continues to be an International strong suit. \"We're still talking about 18 holes of match play, and we've got to remember anything can happen in an 18-hole match,\" Adam Scott told reporters earlier this summer. \"Momentum plays a big deal in these things. We saw that at the last one. We kind of got up early and we nearly hung on (to win).\" Veteran that he is, Scott would tell you that even as he and his mates have become more comfortable in the United States thanks to a full complement of PGA Tour tournaments, another aspect of this biennial affair continues to make matters difficult. That is, an American team that is constantly deep and consistently young. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  How deep? Ten of the 12 players on the United States team are ranked in the top 20 in the Official World Golf Ranking, and the only two that aren't - Max Homa and Kevin Kisner - are close to that benchmark. The team is headlined by world No 1 Scottie Scheffler and has four others in the top 10: Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele, Justin Thomas and Collin Morikawa. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  How young? Two are just 25 years old - Morikawa and Cameron Young - while five others are in their 20s. As for the \"old\" guard, we're talking about Cantlay aged 30, Max Homa at 31, Tony Finau at 32 and Billy Horschel at 35. That's deep, that's young, and that's one potent group teeing it up next week at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina. It's an indication that the Americans will likely be heavy favorites to win for a ninth straight time. Then again, being the underdog is news to the Aussies, the South Africans, the Fijians, the Kiwi, the Canadians, the South Americans, the Japanese, and the Koreans. True, they've not yet come up with an answer to this biennial puzzle, but you'd be doing them a massive disservice if you sold them short. The big picture does them justice as you look at the 2021-22 season: Four of their players - Matsuyama, Im, Lee, and Kim - combined for five wins on the PGA Tour this season. True, the Americans have bigger numbers, combining for 18 victories this season, but Finchem's vision has played out as he predicted. International players have established global stature thanks to a high level of play on the PGA Tour and that will be prominently displayed in this year's Presidents Cup. Focus on the individuals who'll make up the two line-ups - not the past results - and you'll likely find 15 of the world's top 20 names.

The letter, dated September 16 and shared by LIV Golf on Tuesday, included electronic signatures of every player in the field at Rich Harvest Farms where British Open champion Cameron Smith won in his second start on the lucrative circuit. LIV Golf, which launched in June and has so far held five events, applied for recognition in golf's world rankings - which play a key role in deciding entry into golf's four majors - in July and their file remains under review. According to the letter sent by the players, every week that passes without the inclusion of LIV Golf athletes \"undermines the historical value\" of the world rankings. \"To maintain trust, we urge you as one of the true statesmen of sports - to act appropriately to include, on a retroactive basis, the results of LIV Golf events in OWGR's ranking calculations,\" the players wrote. \"An OWGR without LIV would be incomplete and inaccurate.\" The letter was shared by LIV Golf four days after a report saying officials from the upstart circuit feel they are \"being slow played\" by the OWGR. According to the OWGR website, the ranking points breakdown is derived from each tournament's total field rating and points are awarded to players who make the cut and complete an event, subject to their finishing position in the tournament. LIV Golf's 54-hole events do not have a cut. Organisers of golf's four majors have not changed their qualifying rules but players who earned exemption into the blue-riband events due to past results could one day be left out as, for now, they are no longer earning world ranking points. \"We call on you to render a positive decision quickly for the benefit of the integrity of the rankings, the game and all of us who love the sport,\" the players said. \"After all, the fans deserve rankings that are inclusive and accurate. Failure to include 48 of the world's best golfers would mean the fans are being denied what they deserve.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  LIV Golf, which last weekend had 12 major champions in the field, has lured some of the game's biggest names away from the PGA Tour with the promise of guaranteed, big-money paydays and a reduced schedule. Critics say LIV Golf, which is bankrolled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, amounts to blatant \"sportswashing\" by a nation trying to improve its reputation in light of its history of human rights abuses. International captain Trevor Immelman has brushed off the LIV Golf decimation of his Presidents Cup options by insisting his is \"a team of honour\". As the Presidents Cup is sanctioned by the PGA Tour, who banned all the rebels, Immelman has found himself hamstrung when it comes to selection. While the United States also have a number of golfers missing - the likes of Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau, Patrick Reed and Brooks Koepka - captain Davis Love III can still call upon five of the world's top 10 and 11 of the top 20. \"What stopped me (picking those players) is the fact that when I was made captain we signed up to a specific set of rules,\" he said. \"This event is owned and sanctioned by the PGA Tour and our team is a team that plays by the rules. We're a team of our word. We're a team of honour. \"Every single player I spoke to from early on in this process knew exactly what the situation and the consequences were going to be and they knew that if they made certain decisions, it was going to be highly unlikely they were going to be able to represent the International team, so that went into their decision-making. \"All the cards were out on the table, and everybody knew where they stood.\" Get the best prices and book a round at one of 1,700 courses across the UK & Ireland No results found.

The Americans hold a 100 per cent record on home soil since the competition launched in 1994, winning all seven contests held in the United States, while Team USA are chasing a record ninth consecutive victory in the biennial contest. Captains Davis Love III and Trevor Immelman have seen their potential line-ups disrupted by the PGA Tour \"suspending indefinitely\" any player joining the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf circuit, with the ban also preventing them from competing in the Presidents Cup.

Ahead of the contest at Quail Hollow from September 22-25, live on Sky Sports, we take a closer look at the two teams, the potential players missing and whether the International Team can produce an historic upset on American soil… Three of the team who completed a record-breaking Ryder Cup victory at Whistling Straits last year are ineligible to compete, with Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson - who became the first American in the modern era to win all five sessions - all unable to feature. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Johnson has played in four of the last five Presidents Cup teams and has only missed one Ryder Cup since 2010, while Koepka has been involved in the last three Ryder Cups and DeChambeau the last two as well as the 2019 Presidents Cup victory. Patrick Reed, dubbed 'Captain America' for his past performances for Team USA, played in three Ryder Cups and has been part of the last three winning Presidents Cup teams, with Ryder Cup legend Phil Mickelson and fellow former Masters champion Bubba Watson also out of consideration. Jason Kokrak - a two-time winner last season - could have been a possibility had he not elected to join LIV Golf, with Talor Gooch, Matthew Wolff and Harold Varner III all American players who have seen hopes of representing Team USA ended by moving away from the PGA Tour. Cameron Smith was the biggest loss to Immelman's side, with The Players champion and Champion Golfer of the Year ending months of speculation about his golfing future when he defected to LIV Golf at the end of the PGA Tour season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Joaquin Niemann was the other automatic qualifier to give up his place by leaving LIV Golf, with Anirban Lahiri switching at the end of the FedExCup campaign and ending any chance of a captain's pick. Louis Oosthuizen and Marc Leishman will be missing from the International Team for the first time since making their debuts in 2013, while Abraham Ancer was likely to feature after finishing joint-top scorer in 2019 and winning the WGC FedEx St Jude Invitational last August. Former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel and fellow South African Branden Grace - the first two winners of the LIV Golf season - also miss out, having made four and three Presidents Cup appearances respectively and both been part of the heavy defeat in the 2017 contest.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The PGA Tour suspended indefinitely its members who switched to LIV Golf, which would currently mean they would be unable to be a part of Zach Johnson's line-up in Italy. The International Team's qualification campaign ran from The 149th Open at Royal St George's last July through to last month's BMW Championship, with the top eight players on the points list automatically qualifying. Immelman was due to only have four captain's picks but was handed two extra selections when two of the automatic qualifiers - Smith and Niemann - joined LIV Golf, while Team USA had six automatic qualifiers and announced their wildcard picks at the end of the FedExCup season. Scottie Scheffler topped the automatic qualification standings after winning four times on the PGA Tour last season, including a maiden major at The Masters, with Justin Thomas returning after featuring in the last two editions of both the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup.

Former Masters champions Hideki Matsuyama and Adam Scott were among the automatic qualifiers, along with Chile's Mito Pereira, South Korean duo Sungjae Im and Joohyung (Tom) Kim and Canada's Corey Conners. Si Woo Kim returns to make his second Presidents Cup appearance, having featured in the 2017 loss, with compatriot KH Lee selected to make his debut after successfully defending his AT&T Byron Nelson title earlier this season. South Africa's Christiaan Bezuidenhout, Australia's Cam Davis, Colombia's Sebastian Munoz and Canada's Taylor Pendrith were the other four players picked, meaning eight of Immelman's 12-man line-up will be making their debuts. Players compete in sessions of fourballs, foursomes and singles - just like Team USA does when they face Europe in the Ryder Cup - although the Presidents Cup has more matches in the opening two sessions and spreads the contest out across four days rather than three. Foursomes sees two golfers from Team USA compete against a pair from the International Team, with team members alternating between shots and each team using one ball. Fourballs sees each player use his own ball, with the lowest score from each pair counting for the score for their side. Five matches of one format take place on Thursday and five matches of the other on Friday, with four more matches of both fourballs and foursomes then being played across two sessions on Saturday. Sunday sees all 24 players compete in singles matches, where every member from the USA Team plays against an International Team opponent in a head-to-head contest. A total of 30 points are available across the four days, with the team with the most points then claiming the trophy.

Smith was only briefly threatened in the third and final round as he claimed his first title since switching to the LIV series. One of the key moments was a 10-foot par putt on the 13th hole, and neither Dustin Johnson nor Peter Uihlein could do enough to catch him. Smith won $4 million from the $20 million purse for individual play. \"I think I had to prove to myself and other people that I'm still a great player, I'm still out here to win golf tournaments,\" Smith said. \"I didn't have my best stuff, but I stuck tough and made some putts.\" Johnson (70) and Uihlein (69) each made birdie on the par-five 18th hole at Rich Harvest Farms and tied for second, each earning $1,812,500. Johnson's birdie enabled his team to win for the fourth straight time, which was worth an additional $750,000 for Johnson, Talor Gooch, Patrick Reed and Pat Perez. In the five events Johnson has played, he now has made just over $12.5 million. Uihlein's team, captained by Brooks Koepka, finished second, which was worth $375,000 for each team member. With the runner-up finish as an individual and team, Uihlein picked up nearly $2.2 million on Sunday. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Smith's short game did most of the damage. He made enough birdies on the front nine to stay in front, and hit a flop shop to a foot on the par-five 11th for another birdie. Uihlein made birdie on the 13th and looked as though he might be able to trim the deficit to one shot until Smith made his clutch par. Smith left no doubt at the end, hitting his approach over the water to four feet on the 17th to take a three-shot lead to the par-five finish, and then holing an 18-foot birdie putt that gave his team a tie for third with Phil Mickelson's team. Mickelson had his best round since joining Saudi-funded LIV Golf with a 66 and tied for eighth, his first top-10 finish in five events. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Johnson is the only player from the 48-man field to have finished in the top 10 at every LIV Golf event. He was coming off a play-off victory two weeks ago outside Boston. Smith was No 2 in the world when the 29-year-old Australian signed up with LIV Golf after the PGA Tour season ended, the highest-ranked player to join. Johnson remains one of the most significant players to sign up, a two-time major champion who was No 1 in the world longer than any player since Tiger Woods. \"He's probably the one who you look at it feeling he's going to be at the top of the leaderboard every week,\" Smith said. \"I hope he thinks the same of me, and hopefully, we can keep it going.

Speaking after his victory in Chicago, Smith said a decision on whether he and other competitors in the series will receive world rankings points needs to be made soon. LIV Golf applied for recognition in the Official Golf World Rankings, which play a key role in deciding entry into golf's four majors, in July and their file remains under review.

The field here is strong enough and deep enough to where it warrants that, and hopefully it's soon.\" LIV Golf has lured players away from the PGA Tour with staggering sums of money, but the financial windfall could come at a cost for those still looking to compete in the Open, the Masters, PGA Championship and the US Open.

Homa chipped in on the final hole before Willett three-putted from close range to finish a shot behind his playing partner. Willett birdied the first and fourth and when he hung his approach at the eighth up over the flag and watched it trundle back within three feet, a third gain was assured. He gave that shot back immediately to take some of the shine off a strong outward nine but a 16-foot putt at the 10th curled in and he holed from a similar distance from the fringe of the 14th green for another birdie. Homa bounced back from two bogeys in the first four holes with three consecutive birdies around the turn, crowned by a 30-foot putt at the 11th. He came up short with a bunker shot at the last but rattled his chip in off the flag to finish 16-under par and put pressure on Willett's short birdie putt - and amazingly the Englishman twice lipped out from inside five feet for a three-putt par that condemned him to a runner-up finish. Willett could only laugh at his nightmare finish as he shook hands with Homa, who told Sky Sports: \"The last three minutes are kind of a blur. \"I played solid - Danny and Justin (Lower) both played well but that was a wild finish.\" Homa is part of the American team for next week's President's Cup and said: \"I've had a few guys tell me that if the LIV guys hadn't left I wouldn't have made the President's Cup team, so I had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder this week.\" Taylor Montgomery produced the round of the day, eight birdies and no bogeys in a 64 to finish third on 13 under.

As easy as Johnson made it look in the opening round, Saturday at Rich Harvest Farms was such a struggle that he shot over par for the first time in the 14 rounds he has played in the Saudi-funded series. Johnson was lucky the deficit to Smith was only two shots. He came up well short of the green on the par-four 17th and had to make an eight-foot par putt, while Smith took the lead for the first time with his seven-foot birdie putt. On their final hole at the par-five 18th, Johnson's approach took a hard hop over the green. After a free drop from the grandstand, he chipped weakly to eight feet and missed his birdie putt.

Champion Golfer of the Year Cameron Smith and Joaquin Niemann were in the latest wave of LIV Golf signings after the conclusion of the PGA Tour's FedExCup Play-Offs last month, with Mickelson hoping the two tours can \"come together\" for the sake of golf. \"The PGA Tour for the last 20 or 30 years have had all the best players in the world. That will never be the case again,\" Mickelson said after the opening round of the LIV Golf event in Chicago, the fifth of the inaugural season.

The best solution is for us to come together. \"I think that the world of professional golf has a need for the old, historical history of the game product that the PGA Tour provides, and I think that LIV provides a really cool, updated feel that is attracting a lot younger crowd.

Johnson, fresh off a play-off win two weeks ago in Boston and part of the winning team in each of the past three events, carded nine birdies on his way to a bogey-free 63 at Rich Harvest Farms. The former world No 1 holds a commanding advantage over Open champion Smith, who posted six birdies in a blemish-free 66, with Matthew Wolff a further stroke back in third spot.

The eight-time DP World Tour winner, whose only victory in America came via a maiden major title at the 2016 Masters, carded eight birdies in a blemish-free second round at Silverado Resort and Spa to move to 12 under alongside defending champion Max Homa. Willett holed from 25 feet at the par-three second and posted three birdies in a four-hole stretch from the sixth to reach the turn in 32, with the Englishman picking up shots at the 13th and 14th before finishing his impressive round with back-to-back birdies. \"The rough is hit and miss and with the greens being firm as they are, to go bogey free is really good,\" Willett said. \"Kind of a sign of where we're at in terms of playability and where things are. A good two days' work, but there's still a lot of golf left.\" Homa, a two-time winner on the PGA Tour last season and a captain's pick for the Presidents Cup next week, had an eagle and four birdies - including one from 40 feet - in his second-round 67, with his only bogey coming when he three-putted the par-three second. \"The course fits my eyes,\" Homa said. \"I hit a lot of wedges today and I've been hitting the wedges really well, so when I get a lot of wedges from fairways like these, I feel like I can attack the pins.\" The pair head into the weekend with a two-stroke cushion over first-round leader Justin Lower and South Korea's Byeong Hun An in tied-third, while Matt Kuchar is four off the pace in tied-fifth with Taylor Moore and Sahith Theegala.

The Eagles held on after their 20-0 lead shrank to 20-17 early in the fourth quarter, improving to 6-0 for the first time since 2004 when they won their first seven games and went to the Super Bowl. The Eagles scored 20 points in the second quarter and have now outscored opponents 112-27 in that quarter this season, converting 8 of 12 fourth-down attempts coming into the game and keeping the gambles rolling on their first scoring drive, Hurts connecting with A.J. Brown on fourth-and-3 for 11 yards. Then on fourth-and-4 from the 10, the Eagles snared Dallas in a neutral zone infraction for an automatic first down. Miles Sanders scored on a 5-yard TD run and a 7-0 lead. Rush, solid but hardly lighting up the scoreboard as a starter, had a pass deflected and intercepted by Gardner-Johnson, who flapped his arms after the pick and had Eagles fans going wild before Hurts capitalised off the pick and hit Brown for a 15-yard TD and a 14-0 lead. Jake Elliott, who missed last weeks game with a bad ankle, added field goals of 51 and 34 yards to make it 20-0 whilst Elliott's second field goal came after Slay intercepted Rush. Philadelphia put the game away with an efficient drive that took up more than half the fourth quarter as the Eagles converted three third downs and Hurts hit DeVonta Smith for a 7-yard touchdown, the Eagles failing on the 2-point conversion but leading 26-17. Hurts converted two of the third downs on rushing attempts and Philly needed the clutch runs after the Cowboys (4-2) powered their way back into the game. Ezekiel Elliott scored on a 14-yard run in the third that made it 20-10 but Rush countered, throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass to Jake Ferguson in the fourth for a 20-17 game.

Stefon Diggs had 10 catches for 148 yards and a touchdown for Buffalo, with Gabe Davis grabbing the other of Allen's TD tosses as the Bills gained some revenge for their overtime loss in Kansas City in the playoffs last season. Along with that divisional round defeat, the Bills also had their season end at Arrowhead in AFC title game the previous year. Patrick Mahomes, who needed only 13 seconds to drive the Chiefs into field goal range to send that playoff game to overtime last year, had a minute left on the clock to try and get the game-winning score himself this time round, but his interception to Buffalo cornerback Taron Johnson on a pass intended for rookie Skyy Moore all but ended the contest. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mahomes finished with 338 yards passing to go with two touchdowns and two picks, including throwing one in the endzone early on in the game. JuJu Smith-Schuster had five catches for 113 yards and a score for Kansas City, a 42-yard catch and run that gave them the lead for the first time in the second quarter. Allen and the Bills were guilty of wasting a couple of golden opportunities in the first half, with their star quarterback fumbling the football at the Kansas City 13-yard line on their opening series, while they also turned it over on downs following that Smith-Schuster score for KC as Allen threw incomplete on fourth-and-goal from the three-yard line. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But Buffalo answered with a frantic touchdown drive in the final minute of the half. Backed up on their own one-yard line, Allen drove his team the full length of the field in just 73 seconds before finding Davis for a 34-yard touchdown. But, just like in January, the Chiefs only required mere seconds in order to immediately answer back. In the final 16 seconds of the first half, Kansas just about moved into field goal range for Harrison Butker and the kicker successfully struck a 62-yarder through the goal posts to tie the game up at 10 apiece heading into the break. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The back-and-forth contest continued in the second half; after Butker missed from 51 on the opening series, Diggs hauled in a 17-yard TD to have the Bills 17-10 up. But, again, Kansas City answered straight back, with Mecole Hardman tying the game up after a goal-line grab. When the Bills failed on another fourth-down attempt early in the fourth quarter, Butker added a 44-yard field goal to secure Kansas City a 20-17 lead. But, on this occasion the Bills and Allen would have the final say, with the quarterback finding Knox for a 14-yard score to cap a hugely impressive drive, before Mahomes' game-ending error moments later.

Quarterbacks take top billing, and there are none with greater star power right now than Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. \"It's a clash of the titans, an AFC Championship game preview. That's what I expect,\" former NFL quarterback Chris Simms said on NBC's Pro Football Talk this week. \"It's the marquee matchup of the sport right now. \"He [Mahomes] knows who is coming to town. He knows that it's the only guy who is a real threat to his throne as the greatest quarterback in the game right now.\" October 16, 2022, 9:15pm Live on                          Sunday will be the fifth time in the space of two years that the two teams have clashed, with Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs currently boasting a 3-1 advantage over Allen's Bills, including victory in their most recent meeting, an epic 42-36 overtime success in the divisional round of the playoffs last season. An incredible 25 points were scored in the final one minute and 54 seconds of regulation alone, as Allen and Mahomes repeatedly (and with some speed) drove their teams down the field and found the endzone to see the lead again switch hands. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Allen and the Bills had seemingly finally nosed ahead for good courtesy of his fourth touchdown pass of the day to Gabe Davis with only 13 seconds left on the clock. But that, incredibly, still proved to be enough time for Mahomes to engineer a game-tying field goal opportunity for Kansas City. The kick was good and ultimately the Chiefs ran out victorious in overtime as Mahomes hit Travis Kelce for the game-winning TD, with Allen not getting the chance to possess the football under the old 'golden goal' style overtime rules that have since been amended for the playoffs. The Bills, having also had their Super Bowl dreams shattered by the Chiefs in the AFC Championship game the year before, strengthened in the offseason, most notably at linebacker with the addition of veteran pass rusher Von Miller, fresh from lifting the Vince Lombardi Trophy with the Los Angeles Rams last season. As such, coming into the 2022 campaign, Buffalo were many people's favourites. And the first five weeks of the season has done nothing to dispel that notion, with the Bills winning four from five and boasting the league's top-ranked total offense (440.4 yards per game) and passing offense (324.0 YPG). They are also second in scoring (30.4 points per game), bettered only by, yes, the Chiefs (31.8). Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It means that Buffalo are actually favoured by the bookmakers going into Sunday 's meeting, with Mahomes and the Chiefs underdogs at home for, incredibly, the first time in his five-year career as a starting quarterback in the NFL. \"That is the kind of thing that he will shrug about, but you know that it will be burning away at him, that he is not considered the favourite to win a game in his stadium,\" Pro Football Talk presenter Mike Florio said. \"That is going to give him a little extra kick. \"Publicly, Mahomes would say 'I don't care about that'. But privately, he'll find a way to use that to get himself just a little more fired up about the challenge to come.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The only blemish on Buffalo's record so far this season came in Week Three, a 21-19 loss to the Miami Dolphins in a bizarre game that the stats would tell you they otherwise utterly dominated, finishing with 497 total yards of offense compared to only 212 for Miami. The Chiefs, meanwhile, boast an identical 4-1 record, having also slipped up in Week Three, suffering a surprise 20-17 defeat to the then-winless Indianapolis Colts. They have recovered fairly emphatically since, however, putting 41 points up on Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a week later, before then bettering the Las Vegas Raiders last Monday night.

And it certainly won't be their last epic encounter either - perhaps not even this season. As Allen and the Bills look to rectify that playoff heartbreak of their previous meeting, is it finally their time? Sky Sports' resident coach, Jeff Reinebold, certainly thinks so. \"As my friend Ric Flair says, 'to be the man, you've got to beat the man'. And this needs to be the time where the Bills beat the man. \"To do it in Kansas City, that won't be easy - it is going to be off in that stadium - but I really do feel like it is Buffalo's time now.\" Reinebold's Inside The Huddle podcast partner, presenter Neil Reynolds, concurs: \"The Bills are ascending. I actually think this is their year.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But regardless of the outcome on Sunday's contest between the two, the NFL's future truly is in safe hands with Allen and Mahomes leading from the front a crop of exciting young talent at quarterback which includes, but is not limited to, Joe Burrow and last season's AFC champion-Cincinnati Bengals, Jalen Hurts and the unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles and Justin Herbert of the Los Angeles Chargers. It serves as a blessed relief for the sport, particularly as Brady's two-decade long dominance of the NFL finally appears to be drawing to an end. The now 45-year-old has a record seven Super Bowl titles to his name, and while he could yet still add to that haul this season, the expectation is - having retired in the offseason before then changing his mind a few weeks later - that this will indeed be his last go round. And, at the heart of the relentless success Brady enjoyed over the years, it should be noted, was a truly great rivalry. \"Mahomes-Allen is like what Peyton Manning and Tom Brady was for the Indianapolis Colts and New England Patriots back in the day,\" former NFL defensive back Will Blackmon told Sky Sports this week. \"Or like in the 1990s, when it was only the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC.

Nick Sirianni's Eagles remain the NFL's last unbeaten team at 5-0 behind a doubt-defying Jalen Hurts at quarterback and on Sunday host a 4-1 Cowboys outfit that has more than merely survived in the absence of their star QB Dak Prescott, winning their last four-straight. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Their clash on Sunday night beckons as the ideal cocktail of brawn and brain as Philadelphia's admittedly injury-hit offensive line of nimble-footed players uphold one of the NFL's most sophisticated, coercive, varying run games against a rampaging Dallas defensive front and defensive coordinator Dan Quinn's coverage espionage. October 17, 2022, 1:10am Live on                          \"We've just got to play big-boy ball this week,\" said Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham. \"We know it's for the NFC East and this is the start of us. We're playing Dallas. They don't like us and we don't like them and we know what it's going to be in the trenches. \"We know it's going to be one of those games where we gotta fight for everything we want and I'm excited for that.\" Between Sirianni and offensive coordinator Shane Steichen, the Eagles scheme has orientated towards zone running, exploiting the athleticism of an offensive line ranked 11th in run-blocking by Pro Football Focus, with the respect Hurts demands with his legs on the backside also serving as a contributing factor in their early dominance on the ground. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Miles Sanders is currently ranked fourth in the NFL with 414 rushing yards at 4.8 yards per carry and with three touchdowns to his name, while Hurts, showcasing drastic improvement as a stand-and-dissect pocket passer, has already carried the ball 68 times for 266 yards as an asset in both freelancing and designed assignments. \"I was always taught you win games on the front side, you win championships on the back side,\" Siranni told the official Eagles site this week. \"That was always a saying [Indianapolis Colts head coach] Frank [Reich] would say. So, Jalen does a great job of holding that back side. \"As far as scrambles, those are going to happen in the game when he thinks that he has a pressure breakdown or nobody was open on the perimeter, he's got to move and make a play, and you can see he creates - on third-down scenarios can create first downs for you with his legs and with his arm.\" Credit has also rightly been heaped on run game coordinator and offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, whose ground unit ranks fourth overall in the league. It awaits as perhaps the most insightful test yet of the Cowboys defense. \"It will be a big test for us,\" said Cowboys pass rusher Demarcus Lawrence on Thursday. \"I feel like they do have a pretty good offense. They got a good receiver corps, good quarterback, good offensive line. But, also, we [them] 'Boys.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Eagles are ranked first in PFF's pass-blocking grade but find themselves up against a Lawrence and Micah Parsons-spearheaded pass rush that ranks second in the league in sacks (20), first in pressures (104), first in hits (61) and also first in hurries (61) while blitzing a 10th most 55 times. Where Parsons split his time more evenly between on-the-line rusher and off-ball linebacker as a rookie, his reps off the edge have increased to around 85 per cent so far in 2022 and amounted to a pressure rate of 17.7 per cent (second in the league), bettered only by the San Francisco 49ers' Nick Bosa with whom he shares six sacks apiece. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Such has been the Cowboys' impact up front that they are blitzing just 19 per cent of the time and sitting in base defense less than most teams in the league as they tend to rely on a four-man rush. The spotlight on that matchup increased this week as core Eagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata, Landon Dickerson, Jason Kelce and Isaac Seumalo were all limited in multiple practices, having picked up injuries against the Arizona Cardinals last weekend. Quinn's evolution has been a key factor in Dallas' success on defense as the former figurehead of the Seattle Seahawks' Legion of Boom strikes a balance between single and two-high safety coverages, feinting stacked boxes before retreating and teasing light boxes before spinning down. His guessing game will throw him towards the top of head coaching wish lists come the offseason. Dallas' favoured zone coverage defense will face a test in the form of Hurts, who is notably getting the ball out more quickly than last year, and the Eagles' run-pass-option tendencies, with the temptation there for Sirianni to run straight at Dallas with his quarterback. \"The biggest thing, anytime you compete against an offense that has a running quarterback or designed runs where the quarterback is part of it it's more stress on a run defense,\" said Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy. \"I think the biggest thing is, how he is running? Are we talking about a designed run or is it part of the scramble drill?You've got to treat him like you'd treat the five other perimeter players. \"Tackling him will be at a premium for us, that's a major focus for us, they break a lot of tackles so tackling battle we definitely have to win.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Eagles are by no means restricted to the ground, either. Tight end Dallas Goedert is putting up remarkable yards after the catch figures, while receivers AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith are shredding secondaries as effectively as any tandem in the league. On the flip side comes the Eagles' resistance to a Cowboys run game that ranks a respectable ninth in rushing and is currently easing the pressure on stand-in quarterback Cooper Rush. Philadelphia's defense is seventh in points allowed and fourth in yards allowed but 25th in yards per rushing attempt, and will be met by an Ezekiel Elliott and Tony Pollard tandem that has combined for 553 yards on the ground so far this season.

The third-year quarterback has etched his name on a seat at the table of the most accomplished young play-callers in the league since his arrival, igniting Chargers' playoff contention with expansive aerial supremacy and outer pocket athleticism defiant of pre-Draft doubts, now seemingly stemming from the Oregon set-up around him opposed to the mutant himself under center. Herbert enters Week Six having completed 133 of 200 passes for 1,478 yards (second in the league), 10 touchdowns (fifth most) and just two touchdowns with the fifth best passer rating in the league coming off Sunday's win over the Cleveland Browns. All while nursing fractured rib cartilage sustained in Week Two's loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. \"He's definitely learning the game more as far as understanding how to play quarterback and manage the entire offense, but as far as his athletic skill and ability that's at a spot where he's trying to stay consistent,\" Chargers running back Ekeler told Sky Sports. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"There's the mental part of the game where I would say he's made a leap, because now he's in the same offense for the first time ever in his career, he's never had the same offense back-to-back years and finally we have that. \"He's only in year three which is crazy, it seems like he's been around forever because of how much people talk about him. I was with Philip Rivers who was in year 17, that guy knew everything, he knew what defense we were facing before we even put on the film because he knew who the defensive coordinator was and knew what defense they were going to run. \"It takes time. For the mental part, that will come, as far as what he's doing physically, he's definitely giving us a chance to win games and it's up to us to take advantage of him.\" Contrary to the cachet his ascent has warranted, a self-effacing anti rah-rah Herbert continues to advance unfazed by the carnival surrounding his talent. Ekeler jokes of a very different reaction were he central to the same calibre of clamour. \"He brushes it all off,\" said Ekeler. \"I couldn't be the same! That's his personality. He doesn't want anything to do with it, if I had all that I'd be soaking it all up like 'yes, let's talk', but obviously we're all our own individual person. \"We all have different personalities and he doesn't really like to go engage and do all that type of stuff. He will, but it's got to be on his terms for sure and also he's only in his third year so he's still getting comfortable being in the NFL, understanding 'what can I take on, what can I not'. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"I'm sure as his career progresses he'll be more accepting, but maybe not! \"I remember Philip Rivers, 17 years, this guy had no social media, he didn't talk to media as much and he was just about his family life and the team.\" Generational throws have become the norm. Having re-entered the Chiefs game in visible pain, he had found the strength to deliver a 35-yard laser to DeAndre Carter on fourth-and-one amid an 11-play touchdown drive that brought the Chargers within three in the closing stages. And just 10 days later an enchanted NFL stood and watched as he crabbed right of the pocket on third-of-16 before pulling the trigger on a precision-perfect 54-yard bucket to Jaylen Guyton against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Guyton was the beneficiary of Herbert preposterousness last season when he latched onto a 59-yard touchdown strike that split a helpless Logan Ryan and Xavier McKinney against the New York Giants. \"He's got the arm talent to put the ball where he wants to, which is something that not a lot of quarterbacks can,\" Ekeler continued. \"I'm talking deep levels of the field, 50 yards all the way down to intermediate to short range. We definitely have a special guy and I'm looking forward to being his backfield buddy for a few more years. \"Philip (Rivers) wasn't launching that thing 50 yards down the field, if he was it took everything, whereas Herbert he can be off-balance and still sling that thing all the way downfield. \"Even some of these routes across the middle where he's throwing it through defenders at practice, I'm like 'man, guys let's take a moment to watch this throw' and it goes through the fingertips of all these defenders and wham right on the deep over.

Though Ekeler admits he is beginning to witness the Chargers' great hope grow into his voice as one of the most dominant men on the field, particularly should it come to alerting his running back to blitz pick-up assignments. \"For sure, I've seen it a little bit more absolutely,\" said Ekeler. \"That is definitely improvement there and will continue to come as he continues to understand the offense more. \"I remember Philip Rivers, he'd throw a ball in practice and run down to you like 'I need you to get over so I can do this or that', he'd come right over and tell you what he needed you to do. \"That just takes time, comfortability and knowing what you're talking about.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ekeler tied Jonathan Taylor with a league-high 20 total touchdowns last season and finds himself with five in the last two games as the Chargers continue to fare without injured star receiver Keenan Allen. Mike Williams has asserted himself as an ever-present among Herbert's trusted targets, while free agent addition Gerald Everett also appears to be carving out a key role in Joe Lombardi's offense. The contributions of the personnel at Herbert's disposal will be defining when it comes to his development, insists Ekeler. \"I think the leap from him comes within the players around him,\" he said. \"I think he puts us in positions to win and now it's up to us to take advantage of that and actually make things happen. \"He's putting the ball in places where we have to make plays, but if we're dropping them, if we're inconsistent, if we're not getting open then it's on us.

Exactly a week on from the Indianapolis Colts' 12-9 overtime win over the Denver Broncos, the action in Chicago similarly struggled to spark into life, with a Joey Slye goal for Washington - with 46 seconds left of the first half - the only points scored before the break. Justin Fields connected with Dante Pettis midway through the third quarter for a 40-yard touchdown to finally see the Bears on the board and ahead in the game. But a further Slye field goal in the fourth quarter and a first touchdown in the NFL for rookie third-round draft pick Brian Robinson saw the Commanders (2-4) ultimately come away with a crucial victory. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Christian Holmes recovered a muffed punt by Velus Jones deep in Chicago territory to set up Robinson's goal-line game winning score. It marks an incredible turnaround for the running back, six weeks on from being shot twice in the knee when the victim of an attempted robbery or carjacking in Washington. The loss for the Bears (2-4) is their third in a row on the season. Second-year QB Fields, who said after the game that he re-aggravated an injury to his left shoulder, was intercepted by Jonathan Allen when deep into Washington territory in the first half. The Commanders defense also forced Chicago to turn the ball over on downs three times in the game, and twice from down near the goal-line - the most crucial of those was a clutch stop just shy of the endzone in the closing minute of the game as the Bears looked to regain the lead, Benjamin St-Juste stopping Darnell Mooney from scoring a potential game-winner. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Washington quarterback Carson Wentz had earlier overthrown Curtis Samuel on a two-point conversion play following Robinson's TD, while Slye missed with a 48-yard field goal with just under two minutes left that would have added to the Commanders' lead and seen them avoid such drama late on.

They've played their asses off - they come in, they show up, they work hard, don't complain. They hear all of the stuff, and they've got to deal with it - I respect them for that. \"And everybody says I don't want anything to do with Carson. Well, b*******. I'm the f****** guy that looked at the analytics, watched the tape. That's what p**** me off because the young man doesn't deserve to have that all the time.\" Rivera then stormed out of the post-match press conference. Bears Commanders quarterback, Carson Wentz: \"Coach Rivera, he's awesome. \"It's definitely special [his post-match defence of the QB]. He's going to speak his mind and be very direct to the point. In this business, that means a lot. \"I think guys love that about him and he's going to be straight-up, very motivational and [we] respond to him very well.

The woman, referred to in court documents as Jane Doe, filed the lawsuit on Thursday in Harris County District Court in Houston. She claims Watson asked to have sex with her after getting a massage in a hotel room in 2020. When she refused, he was able to pressure her into oral sex. According to the lawsuit, Watson paid her $300, although her normal charge is $115 for an hourly massage. The woman claims Watson continued to text her following the encounter. She's seeking minimal compensatory damages but has suffered mental anguish because of Watsons behavior, according to the lawsuit. Watson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said he's trying find out the accuser's name. \"It is against Texas Civil procedure to file an anonymous civil law suit, though it is certainly permissible in a criminal case,\" Hardin said in an email to AP. \"But in a civil case where you are seeking money, the defendant is entitled to know who you are.\" The NFL did not immediately responded to a request for comment. Watson is serving an 11-game NFL suspension for alleged sexual misconduct. The three-time Pro Bowler returned to the Browns' training facility earlier this week and is allowed to interact with his teammates and coaches after being banned since August 30. October 16, 2022, 5:00pm Live on                          Watson has settled civil lawsuits with 23 of 24 women claiming he acted inappropriately while getting massages when he played for the Houston Texans. The Browns had no immediate comment on the new lawsuit. The 27-year-old Watson settled in August with the league, agreeing to his suspension, a $5 million (£4.4m) fine and to undergo independent counseling and therapy. He's not eligible to begin practicing until November 14. If he abides by the provisions in the settlement, Watson can be reinstated on November 28 and play on December 4, when the Browns visit Houston. Watson has not spoken to the media since the settlement was reached on August 18. He was seen in the Browns' locker room Thursday, as his teammates prepared to play the New England Patriots on Sunday. Two separate grand juries in Texas declined to indict Watson on criminal charges following complaints by more than two dozen women of lewd behavior. Watson has always maintained his innocence, professing he never harassed or assaulted anyone. Before he played in an exhibition game this summer, Watson apologized for the first time to any women who may have been impacted by his behavior. The Browns traded three first-round draft picks in March to Houston for Watson before signing him to a five-year, $240 million contract that's fully guaranteed.", "washington-commanders-chicago-bears-carson-wentz-being-made-a-scapegoat-after-head-coach-ron-rivera-comments": "The Washington Commanders travel to the Chicago Bears on Thursday night in the midst of a four-game losing streak and with serious questions being asked of their quarterback - even by their own head coach. Carson Wentz arrived in Washington via trade from the Indianapolis Colts this offseason. He is averaging 278 pass yards per game so far this season, throwing 10 touchdowns to six interceptions. It's far from a dreadful stat line, yet the Commanders find themselves 1-4 through the first five weeks, losing four straight since an opening-weekend win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Head coach Ron Rivera, when asked earlier this week why other NFC East teams (all 4-1 or better) are ahead of Washington in the division at this point, he responded: \"Quarterback. \"The truth is this is a quarterback-driven league and if you look at the teams that have been able to have sustained success, they have been able to build it around a specific quarterback.\" Rivera did add, however, that he had no regrets about the trade for Wentz despite the team's struggles and he has since apologised for his comments. \"No, I've got no regrets about that quarterback,\" he said. \"I think our quarterback has done some good things. There's been a couple games that he struggled.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"The way he performed [in defeat to the Tennessee Titans on Sunday], it just shows you what he's capable of and we chose him because we believe in him.

He addressed it in a team meeting, which I thought was really cool and what he meant by it all. I feel very confident. \"Nothing for me that I'm overly concerned about.\" Wentz, the No 2 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, had five injury-affected seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles before being traded to the Colts where he lasted only one year as the team failed to make the playoffs with a 9-8 record. Former NFL quarterback Chris Simms, reacting to Rivera's comments on Pro Football Talk (Sky Sports NFL, weekdays, 6pm), said: \" I'm a little shocked, I really am. You're fuelling a narrative there. \"Maybe I'm missing something. There were issues with him in Philadelphia and we know there were issues in Indianapolis. Maybe that's still real? Maybe he's not a good locker room guy and good leader of your football team. \"But Carson Wentz is not this team's problem. Has he been perfect? No. But they have no offensive line, they get totally overrun constantly; they also can't run the football. \"And their defense isn't really worth a damn. They have five first-round draft picks in their front seven, but they can't get anything done and he's a defensive coach. \"I'm throwing the challenge flag on all of it. He [Wentz] is a scapegoat.\" Simms added: \"Good for him [Rivera] to recognise that he shouldn't have said that and addressed that with his team - that's the right thing to do. I'll give him credit. \"But, still, the damage was done. He opened the door a little bit for the 'let's pile on Wentz' conversation. And that's where it was wrong.\" Wentz now has the opportunity to, crucially, get Washington back to winning ways on Thursday night against a 2-3 Bears outfit who have also had their struggles this season. It has been confirmed that Wentz will start the game despite dealing with a biceps tendon strain near his throwing shoulder that raised questions about his availability on a short week. The Commanders had Wentz down as a 'limited participant' in practice on Monday and Tuesday, but upgraded him to a 'full participant' on Wednesday, removing him from the final injury report.

Protecting quarterbacks is a priority for the NFL, whose owners pay big money to the players who represent the face of their franchise. Twenty-five QBs are making at least $25 million this season. As a result, roughing the passer penalties are called when an on-field official deems a defensive player to have made illegal contact with the quarterback. The NFL rulebook also notes: \"When in doubt about a roughness call or potentially dangerous tactic against the quarterback, the referee should always call roughing the passer.\" Per NFL Research, there have been 27 flags for roughing the passer though the first five weeks of the 2022 season, with 25 accepted. In 2021, there were 51 called and 48 accepted by the same stage. The numbers might be down, but the two controversial flags from this week have brought roughing the passer calls under the microscope again. On Sunday, Atlanta Falcons defensive tackle Grady Jarrett was flagged for a seemingly harmless sack on Brady. Jarrett's tackled should have forced a fourth down and allowed Atlanta to get the ball back with just under three minutes remaining. Instead, the penalty gave the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a fresh set of downs and allowed them to run out the clock on their way to a 21-15 victory. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Jarrett said on Tuesday: \"Just looking back on it, I'm still kind of left clueless on what I'm expected to do in that situation. \"I'm not saying that it cost us the game, but it cost us an opportunity to win the game and if it's costing people games, it's going to cost people livelihoods, going to cost people opportunities. \"Obviously this happened to us, the Falcons, but forget all that, it's about the sport. People watch us to be entertained and then when you do it the right way, that's what makes it so frustrating, because you did follow the rules and you didn't do anything bad. \"Let's give the game what the game is owed, and that's the best product we can put on the field.\" On Monday night, the Kansas City Chiefs had just scored to trim their deficit to 17-7 against the Las Vegas Raiders when defensive lineman Chris Jones stripped quarterback Derek Carr from behind just before half-time. Jones landed on Carr while also coming up with the loose ball, but the flag was thrown and so the turnover was missed. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Former NFL quarterback Chris Simms said on NBC's Pro Football Talk (Sky Sports NFL, weekdays, 6pm): \"The NFL has got to step in here. We have a real problem. \"They're ruining the sport. Every week right now we're seeing plays that dictate football games - big plays - and 'Johnny Referee' steps in. \"Chris Jones has possession of the football, it's wrong in all aspects. We saw it of course with Brady too. \"We had this in Weeks One, Two and Three as well… it's just that in the last week, we've had them in the biggest moments of games. Now people are starting to go 'something is wrong here'. \"It's not fair. It's not a good watch and it turns me off as a fan of the sport. It's a real problem. \"You're taking away a big aspect of the [defense's] game, which is physicality and making the quarterback feel uncomfortable.\" In response to the outrage since, the NFL plans to discuss - but not change - roughing the passer penalties, a person with direct knowledge of the matter has told the Associated Press. The person, speaking on condition of anonymity because the conversations are internal, said changes to the rule are not expected during the season. The person also said the league has not given officials a directive to emphasise roughing calls following Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa's concussion. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tagovailoa's concussion suffered in their Week Four loss to the Cincinnati Bengals drew criticism after he'd been allowed to play despite having seemingly been concussed only four days prior in the team's win over the Buffalo Bills. Chiefs defender Jones, who was flagged for the controversial roughing the passer penalty against Carr on Monday night, has suggested a solution. \"We've got to be able to review it in the booth,\" he said after the game. \"I think that's the next step for the NFL as a whole. \"If we're going to call it a penalty at that high (of rate), then we've got to be able to review it and make sure, because sometimes looks can be deceiving.\" That change is unlikely, however, with the NFL having already gone down that road when making pass interference penalties reviewable for one season after an egregious missed foul late in the fourth quarter of the NFC championship in January 2019 cost the New Orleans Saints a trip to the Super Bowl. The experiment failed and the rule wasn't considered again for the following season.

The game picks for the Week Six double-header live on Sky have been announced, with the San Francisco 49ers (3-2) travelling to the Atlanta Falcons (2-3) in the opening game of the evening - kick-off at 6pm. Neil Reynolds will be joined in the studio by Jason Bell and a pair of Super Bowl winners in Torry Holt and Will Blackmon, while we'll also be hearing from Phoebe Schecter and Sky Sports News' Danyal Khan at a 49ers fan event in Leeds where former Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford and San Francisco player Joe Nedney will be among those in attendance. Then, following on from the action in Atlanta, is the latest meeting of Mahomes and Allen. These two superstars of the sport have met three times previously, with Mahomes currently holding a 3-1 advantage, including most recently and most crucially an epic 32-36 overtime triumph in last year's divisional round of the playoffs. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Allen threw for a staggering 329 yards and four touchdowns in that game and still came out on the losing side, while Mahomes had 378 passing yards and three TDs - and famously got his team in position for a game-tying field goal with only 13 seconds left on the clock after the fourth of those Allen TDs had earned Buffalo a late three-point lead. Mahomes and the Chiefs were ultimately victorious in overtime, scoring on their first possession, with Allen left helplessly watching on from the sideline.

Rounding off the Sunday night triple-header, we join our friends at NBC for Football Night in America and a classic Sunday Night Football encounter, as the last remaining undefeated team in the NFL, the Philadelphia Eagles (5-0) host their bitter NFC East rivals, the Dallas Cowboys (4-1), who come into the contest fresh from their own four-game win streak - kick-off is at 1.20am early on Monday morning. Elsewhere, the Week Six action gets under way with the traditional Thursday night fare as the struggling Washington Commanders (1-4) head to the Chicago Bears (2-3), both teams desperate for a victory to keep their fading hopes for this season alive. It's live on Sky Sports NFL from 1.15am, Friday morning.

It was great to have the Green Bay Packers, and their fans, over for the first time; here are my other major takeaways from Week Five... It was a statement performance from the Dallas Cowboys defense on Sunday, albeit against a Los Angeles Rams offensive line that is really struggling. We saw just how dominant Micah Parsons is. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  While the Cowboys wait for Dak Prescott to return from injury at quarterback, they have rounded into a complete team. Once he's back, then they'll be very good to watch. There's a huge matchup coming this Sunday night, as the Cowboys go on the road to face the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles, but Dallas have the defensive weapons to be able to stand toe-to-toe with the Eagles. They just need Cooper Rush to continue to not make any mistakes. That's all they're asking of him right now and he's delivering. I think it promises to be a very competitive game against the Eagles. As the Buffalo Bills handled the Pittsburgh Steelers 38-3 on Sunday, we were reminded that their quarterback Josh Allen is a definite MVP candidate this season. Right now, there is no one playing better football than him. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He makes 'wow' plays every week, and now his arm strength is being matched by his accuracy. He has weapons all over the field, and he makes the players around him better every week. He is exactly what I thought he was going to be coming into the season, an MVP candidate. And the same for Buffalo, a Super Bowl contender. We saw this weekend, with their handy 37-15 victory over the Carolina Panthers, the way that the San Francisco 49ers plan to win games of football - with just enough of Jimmy Garoppolo thrown in. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  They're going to rely on the playmakers they have around him and on that superb defense of theirs. I think that defense is ultimately what is going to drive this team. If San Francisco become a stronger force this season, the defense will be a big factor. The 49ers have good depth, on both side of the ball, they are well coached and they're showing that they'll be in the mix come crunch time. The NFC West is really tight, but if you were to ask me right now who I'm leaning towards taking it, it would be the 49ers. That's saying something, considering the defending Super Bowl champs are in that division, but they just don't look right at the moment. It feels like an incredible question to ask, but I asked it in the Sky Sports studio on Sunday night: are the Seattle Seahawks better with Geno Smith at quarterback than with Russell Wilson? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But when you think about how much Wilson is struggling and how out of sorts the Denver Broncos look right now, it's actually a fair question to ask, because Geno meanwhile is firing on all cylinders for the Seahawks. He is playing free, playing for fun and is relishing this second chance he is getting. Seattle can't really play defense at the moment, which won't please head coach Pete Carroll, but Geno, D.K. Metcalf and Tyler Lockett are all clicking on offense. They're making the Seahawks exciting to watch. The New York Jets showed with their 40-17 win over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday that there is a really bright future round the corner for this franchise. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  They're 3-2 through the first five weeks, which represents a really good start. But it's not even about this season necessarily; they have so many great young players stepping up each week. Breece Hall had 197 scrimmage yards, Zach Wilson scored on a touchdown run, Sauce Gardner had a safety and an interception that set up a TD. They've had a couple of good draft classes and it really bodes well as head coach Robert Saleh looks to build a winning culture there in New York. I have been very impressed by the way the Jets have put together wins in different ways over the last couple weeks. Allen raced out of the gates against the Steelers on Sunday. He had a 98-yard touchdown pass to Gabe Davis on the first drive. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He threw for a career-high 424 yards in the game, but that could quite easily have been 624! The Bills called off the dogs in the second half; Allen had 348 yards, an entire game's worth of statistics, by half time. The guy is elite. And he goes up against another truly elite quarterback in Patrick Mahomes this weekend - their meeting against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday is a massive game. Because of what happened in the playoffs last year, this means something to Allen and the Bills. This could be the new Tom Brady-Peyton Manning rivalry. Allen and Mahomes are two giants of the NFL already. It's one thing to intercept a pass that has been thrown in the air, it's another to recover a fumble that has already been knocked on the floor. But when the ball is firmly in the grasp of the opposing receiver, and you just take it away from him and start running in the other direction, you're not just taking the football, you're crushing his spirit and wrestling the game away from the Chicago Bears. It was a next-level turnover from Cameron Dantzler to win it for the Minnesota Vikings against the Bears on Sunday. An amazing play! What Brian Daboll has done with the New York Giants has been noteworthy through the first five weeks of the season. To have that team 4-1, when they're not completely sold on quarterback Daniel Jones, they're paper-thin at wide receiver and they're bringing along young players on defense, has been amazing. It just speaks to Daboll's coaching. It speaks to the team buying in too. There is a toughness there; they dug deep against the Packers in London on Sunday, having found themselves in a 17-point hole in the first half. I'm very impressed by the Giants, and particularly their creativity on offense under Daboll. That has got to be the most worst result for Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars this season, to lose at home to the then-winless Houston Texans. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Lawrence had the five turnovers in Philadelphia the previous week, four of them fumbles against the Eagles, and then he follows that up with two interceptions against Houston is hugely disappointing. The reason they're on my radar is I've backed the Jags to be good, competitive this year... so now how do you respond? It's a much-more talented team, and way more mature team than they showed on Sunday, so how do Lawrence and Jacksonville bounce back after a tough couple of weeks? I'll be keen to see.

The New York Giants won their third game out of three in London, joining the Minnesota Vikings - who themselves won the week before - as the only two NFL teams with a 3-0 record in England's capital. The Giants' 27-22 win over the Packers at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was the fifth NFL game out of six played there to be decided by a single score. The only one that wasn't was the Carolina Panthers' 37-26 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week Six of the 2019 season.

The last team to suffer such a fate was the Giants who beat the New Orleans Saints 52-27 in Week 14 of the 2012 season before losing 34-0 to the Atlanta Falcons the following week. The Lions were 0-6 on fourth down against the Patriots - the most 4th down attempts without a conversion by any team in a game since at least 1991.

The 2019 fifth-round pick reeled in six catches for 79 yards at 13.2 yards per reception while playing 54.1 per cent of snaps in the Giants' 27-22 comeback victory at Tottenham, carrying the load through the air in the absence of last year's marquee free agency acquisition Kenny Golladay, second-year weapon Kadarius Toney, rookie receiver Wan'Dale Robinson and veteran leader Sterling Shepard. For context, he had not played more than 20 per cent of snaps in either of his first two games this season, before managing 60 per cent in Week Four. He also came away with a PFF grading of 89.6, the highest of any Giants player on offense ahead of left tackle Andrew Thomas (75.3). Where build-up during the week had massaged the penetrative field-flipping influence of Saquon Barkley, vindicated by a standout performance on the day, along with the toughness of quarterback Daniel Jones to shrug off an ankle injury sustained the previous week, a Big Blue receiver group projected as a defining hindrance executed Mike Kafka's gusty, shifty scheme to its desired effect. Slayton's London exploits in turn combined with the early season prominence of an overlooked Richie James in further underlining a Brian Daboll and Kafka offense with no constraints when it comes to accommodating anyone and everyone who is up to the task, injuries and availability permitting. \"Mental toughness. It's not perfect. It's easy when everything is going great for people, everyone is saying good things about them,\" said Daboll. \"This kid had a good mindset - I shouldn't say kid - young man and made the most of his opportunities when he had an opportunity to. When you make plays, you get more opportunities and he did that.\" His role on the day was less inadvertent, improvisation or even make-shift, but more so a designed chunk-play wrinkle to the Giants playbook despite his inactivity early in the campaign. A first half belonging to the Packers had seen efforts to jump Barkley to the outside on run or screen scenarios smothered by the lateral speed of linebackers Quay Walker and De'Vondre Campbell, while Rashan Gary was proven the backfield invader as advertised to the UK's NFL rookies. The first inkling of a Giants receiver gaining separation, an art Jones has been starved of at times, came courtesy of Slayton as he earned a yard on Eric Stokes to collect a pass on his play-action crossing route for a gain of 26. It paved the way for the Giants' first points of the game through Graham Gano's 48-yard field goal in the final seconds of the opening quarter. He escaped Stokes again at the sideline for a chain-moving 10-yard pickup and out-wrestled the Packers cornerback for a catch that turned third-and-nine into first-and-goal on Daniel Bellinger's second quarter touchdown drive, before logging back-to-back gains of 14 yards on third-and-three and 13 yards on the ensuing first down during the Giants' field goal possession to start the second half. \"In this profession it's always like that, it's football, somebody is going to get hurt eventually,\" said Slayton of staying ready for his moment. \"You've always got to be ready but obviously we've had an abnormal amount of injuries recently so I think everybody is just trying to take advantage of their opportunities.\" Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka again earned praise for his balance between 11 personnel and the heavier sets, including split backfield and wildcat looks, to limit the Packers' defensive variation. \"Kafka did a great job putting together a plan and obviously at the end of the day it's on us to go out there and execute it but he definitely does a good job of knowing everybody's strengths and putting us in a position to be successful,\" Slayton added. \"Sometimes it's just about executing what you've called, sometimes you have plays that could have worked in the first half but I made a mistake or somebody made a mistake, the big thing was we just needed to execute and we were able to do that in the second half.\" An injection of red zone competence and creativity by way of Kafka was underlined on Bellinger's touchdown run as the Giants called a scripted double reverse capped by the rookie tight end side-stepping one tackler before scurrying into the end zone. \"I enjoy it a lot, I feel like these are the best coaches I've ever been around, they're brilliant coaches, they don't just help everybody, they keep us together as an offense, they play off the strengths of Daniel Jones, Saquon, when we lack in an area they help us improve,\" said Bellinger. Slayton is no splash-play novice for the Giants having amassed 98 catches for 1,491 yards and 11 touchdowns at roughly 15 yards per catch over his first two seasons, but a 10.8 percent career drop rate has partially marred his stock in an already-tumultuous period for the franchise rebuild prior to Daboll's arrival. While individual errors have dented his stock at times, what has never been denied is his ability to secure separation as an intermediate-to-deep threat in a way few other Giants can. He watched as the organization dug into their pockets to acquire a since ineffective Golladay, watched as they traded back to Draft the oft-injured Toney and watched as they welcomed trade partners to no avail. Sunday was evidence there remains a place for him Slayton under Daboll, whose apparent success in building a relationship with players lacking their desired snaps is testament to the environment he has created. The Giants are 4-1 for the first time since 2009 as they prepare to take on the Baltimore Ravens in Week Six, marking a reunion for defensive coordinator Wink Martindale with his former employers.

Davante Adams had two length touchdown grabs of his own, of 58 and 48 yards, for the Raiders, the second of which gave Las Vegas the opportunity to tie the game up with four and a half minutes remaining. But, instead of opting for the extra point attempt, Raiders head coach Josh McDaniels opted to go for a two-point conversion to give them back the lead, but Josh Jacobs - who had shredded the Chiefs defense all night, to the tune of 154 yards and a TD on 21 carries - was stuffed at the goal line. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Raiders got the ball back one last time with two and a half minutes left, and a long third-down pass to Adams appeared to get them in field-goal range. But the play was reviewed and Adams had failed to get both feet in bounds, and Derek Carr threw incomplete on fourth-and-one to practically end the game. In his frustration following the defeat, Adams pushed a cameraman to the ground as he was entering the tunnel to the team dressing room. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He has since apologised for the incident, posting on Twitter: \"Sorry to the guy I pushed over at the game.

MY APOLOGIES man hope you see this.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Chiefs The loss for the Raiders (1-4) is their fourth-straight to the Chiefs (4-1), and ninth in the last 10 meetings between the two teams. Adding to their frustration is the fact that the outcome could have been so different, with Las Vegas racing into a 17-0 lead midway through the second quarter. But the momentum began to shift when Kelce first found the endzone for the first of his four scores before half-time, and finally reached the endzone for the Chiefs. A very questionable roughing the passer call on Kansas City defensive tackle Chris Jones, that negated a big turnover shortly before the break, served only to fire up the team, and particularly head coach Andy Reid - who gave referee Carl Cheffers more than a piece of his mind on his way to the locker room. The Chiefs opened the second half with consecutive scoring drives capped by Kelce, either side of a Raiders punt, to suddenly give them a 24-20 lead. That advantage was reduced to 24-23 before fill-in kicker Matthew Wright - who hit a 59-yarder before half-time to set the franchise record - yanked a 37-yarder left, only for Raiders defensive end Malcolm Koonce to be called for holding, gifting KC an automatic first down, with Mahomes finding Kelce once again to extend their lead to 30-23. The scoring would end the way it started, with Adams finding the endzone with a long touchdown, but the failed two-point conversion to follow allowed the Chiefs to escape with the win. Week Six in the NFL kicks off with the Washington Commanders (1-4) travelling to the Chicago Bears (2-3) on Thursday Night Football, with both teams desperate for a win in an attempt to stay competitive this season.

And it's hard to argue with Florio's assessment, especially given Mahomes' most recent performance in the Week Four, 41-31 win over Tom Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Kansas City QB threw for 249 yards and three touchdowns in the contest, including one particularly magical score in which he flicked a pass to Clyde Edwards-Helaire in the endzone after a stunning 360 spin move to evade a closing defender.

That's what makes him so special.\" As much as Mahomes continues to impress, the Chiefs haven't had things all their own way this season, with the team barely scraping out a 27-24 win over the Los Angeles Chargers in Week Two and then succumbing to a 20-17 loss to the then-winless Indianapolis Colts a week later. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Yet, the arrival of the Raiders on Monday night will represent a warm, familiar feeling. Kansas City have held off their AFC West rivals for much of the last decade, topping the division in each of the last six years and owning a dominant 16-3 record against the Silver and Black since Andy Reid's arrival as head coach in 2013. Their two latest wins in 2021, against a Raiders which made the postseason, came at a staggering 89-23 combined scoreline, in which Mahomes threw for 664 total yards and seven touchdowns. Stretch that out to Mahomes' eight career contests against the Raiders and it tallies at 2,546 pass yds and 22 pass TDs, his most against any single opponent.

The decision ends the former Baylor coach's tenure five games into his third losing season after Sunday's 37-15 home loss to San Francisco. The 47-year-old was lured away from Baylor with a seven-year, guaranteed $62 million contract by David Tepper, the second-wealthiest owner in the NFL. Rhule has gone 11-27 during his three seasons in Carolina and leaves with four years left of that seven-year contract that was handed to him in 2020, meaning that the side will owe him more than $40 million on his departure. He will now be replaced by former head coach of the Arizona Cardinals and secondary coach Steve Wilks on an interim basis. In a statement put out on social media on Monday, the team said: \"The Panthers on Monday parted ways with head coach Matt Rhule, after the team fell to 1-4 with a home loss to San Francisco. \"He leaves with an 11-27 record (.289 winning percentage). \"The 47-year-old Rhule had generally turned his college teams at Temple and Baylor around in his third season, but that bounce hadn't happened here so far. \"He will be replaced on an interim basis by defensive pass game coordinator/secondary coach Steve Wilks. \"The 53-year-old Wilks spent one year as head coach of the Arizona Cardinals, and six years on the Panthers staff from 2012-17.\" The Panthers hoped Rhule could turn things around in his third year as he did at Baylor and at Temple before that. The team had constant turnover at quarterback under Rhule, with Teddy Bridgewater as the starter in 2020 and Sam Darnold and Cam Newton getting starts last year. The Panthers traded for Baker Mayfield this offseason but the 2018 No. 1 overall draft pick has had a difficult start, ranking last in the NFL in ESPNs total quarterback rating.

With their 19-17 victory, the Ravens move to 3-2 on the season and claim sole possession of first place in the AFC North, while Cincinnati slip back to 2-3. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow had given his side the lead for the first time in the game with a one-yard scoring plunge with just under two minutes to go, but that was enough time for Baltimore to drive into field goal range and set things up for Tucker, who had earlier been successful from 58 yards with a kick in the third quarter. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tucker's game-winner was just a routing 43-yarder and extended his streak to 61-straight successful field goals in the fourth quarter and overtime. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson shook off a rough night passing, expertly leading the Ravens down the field on the final drive. Baltimore have blown leads of 21 and 17 points already in their previous two home games this season, when losing to the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills, respectively. They squandered a 10-point advantage in this one but recovered late on to claim the victory.

Will Teddy Bridgewater step up in the absence of Tua Tagovailoa? And two former coaching team-mates and friends meet; we pick out six reasons to watch on Sunday @ 6pm, as the New York Jets host the Miami Dolphins... The Zach Wilson era has been slow to get going in New York, in truth. In his rookie season, the No 2 overall pick in the 2021 Draft threw seven interceptions over his first three games, while he followed that up with one more in each of the subsequent two weeks to make him only the fourth NFL QB after DeShone Kizer, Zach Mettenberger and Blake Bortles - (such esteemed company!) - to be picked off at least once in each of his first five starts in the league. Halting his development was a knee injury in Week Seven which would keep him out for four weeks, and the team, and fans (briefly) rallied round back-up Mike White to one of only four of their wins on the season - over the eventual AFC-champion Cincinnati Bengals, no less. When Wilson returned to the line-up, though, the team did not finish the season strongly, he did, throwing five touchdowns to only two picks (including zero over the final five weeks of the season), along with four rushing scores. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It meant that much was expected heading into year two, but Wilson was again sidelined with a knee injury until last weekend, when he put in a superb showing in his first start of the season to see the Jets beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in their own backyard, rallying them from a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit. Will he and the Jets ride that momentum into this Sunday and now get a first home win of the season on the board? It has been a tough 10 days for Miami. Not only did they lose their starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to concussion in their Week Four, Thursday night loss to the Bengals - their first of the season - but they, and the league, have been heavily criticised for the handling of their QB too. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tua had left the field just four days earlier in their Week Three game against the Buffalo Bills with what was initially described by the Dolphins as a head injury before subsequently returning to the action. He was then listed as 'questionable' ahead of their road game in Cincinnati, said to be suffering from a sore back and ankle injury, before being cleared to play - only to be stretchered off the field and taken to hospital with head and neck injuries after being slammed violently to the turf, his fingers flexed awkwardly in what is known as the 'fencing response' to neurological trauma. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Former rugby league player Stevie Ward, captain of Leeds Rhinos before he was forced to retire at the age of 27 due to concussions he suffered on the field, told Sky Sports: \"He [Tua] could have died,\" adding: \"It's a respect thing. I don't think he was treated as a person. He was treated as someone that they just wanted to get back on the field.\" Tua has been ruled out of Sunday's game against the Jets due to the concussion he suffered in Cincinnati, with it not yet known when he will be cleared to return to competitive action. The National Football League and its players' association, meanwhile, announced on Saturday that they have agreed to enhanced concussion protocols. But with such distractions to contend with over the last week and a half, how will Miami respond on the field? Also, somewhat lost in the shuffle from the fallout of the Tua concussion drama, is just how well he had been playing to start the season and therefore how big a loss his absence could be for this Dolphins outfit. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tua has been much-maligned since entering the NFL as the No 5 overall pick in the 2020 Draft, with his arm strength, or lack thereof, a particular criticism. But, having added superstar speed merchant Tyreek Hill in the offseason after a blockbuster trade with the Kansas City Chiefs, pairing him with the equally explosive Jaylen Waddle at receiver, it has really opened up the Miami passing attack. There is also the offensive genius that is Mike McDaniel at head coach calling the plays, having honed his craft under fellow savant Kyle Shanahan with the San Francisco 49ers, and Tua had taken full advantage, throwing for 1,035 yards through the first four games, with eight touchdowns to only three interceptions and with a league-leading 109.9 passer rating. The Miami offense as a whole, meanwhile, has averaged 6.36 yards per play in 2022 - second in the NFL - while they have put up 24.5 points per game, good enough for ninth in the league, and round out the top three in terms of pass yards per game, at 291.8. Now Teddy Bridgewater will be required to keep this Miami express train chugging along at the same pace. Predominantly a back-up QB over the last five or so years, is he capable? We are about to find out. McDaniel is not the only former member of the 49ers' coaching staff to fly the nest, with their one-time defensive coordinator and team-mate of McDaniel's on the sideline, Robert Saleh, also moving on. Saleh has not found the going quite so easy on the field as McDaniel, who swiftly won his first three games in charge this season, but there are signs he is starting to turn things around in New York. That being said, he is not relishing the prospect of going up against his friend on the opposite sideline this weekend. \"I hate it, I hate it, I hate it,\" Saleh said. \"It's never easy. But at the same time, a tremendous amount of respect for him and what he is doing. And hopefully we can flip it to where we are the top two teams in the division every year and we can keep this rolling.\" The respect is very much mutual, with McDaniel fully aware of the challenge Saleh and his staff present to his side when Miami travel into New York. \"I have a clear-cut vision of what it's going to take for our guys to be happy with their performance on Sunday,\" he said. \"Because I know how detailed and passionate and how much energy those guys are preparing for us this week.\" Following on from the Jets' 24-9 hammering at the hands of the Baltimore Ravens on the opening weekend which stretched Saleh's record to 4-14 since taking over as head coach, he said: \"We're all taking receipts on all the people who continually mock and say that we're not going to do anything.\" Despite the unwanted four-win record, Saleh was confident enough in the talent he had assembled to add: \"I'm taking receipts and I'm going to be more than happy to share them with all of you when all is said and done.\" And while a .500 record at 2-2 is no time to be cashing in those receipts just yet, there are signs that under Saleh the Jets are indeed finally starting to turn things around. Their 2022 draft class, for example, flash weekly on the field - Ahmad 'Sauce' Gardner already looks like one of the best cornerbacks in the game, receiver Garrett Wilson has impressed, and runner Breece Hall is becoming more and more involved. This is a young team that are going to grow together under Saleh and, with another win on Sunday, the Jets will be far from a laughing matter. Whatever the result on Sunday, these two teams normally guarantee some entertaining fare. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  As mentioned earlier, the Jets recovered from a 10-point deficit to beat the Steelers late on last week, while their first win of the season - in Week Two against the Cleveland Browns - was even more remarkable, as a Nick Chubb touchdown with a minute and 55 seconds remaining saw Cleveland up by 13, securing themselves a win probability of 99.9 per cent in the process. Cue a 66-yard touchdown reception from Corey Davis, a successful onside kick and then a winning grab by Garrett Wilson in the endzone with 22 seconds left to cap a stunning turnaround. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  And the last-minute drama has not just been confined to Gang Green in New York. No, the Dolphins have been at it down in South Florida too. In Week Two, having trailed the Ravens by as many as 21 in the fourth quarter, Miami put up 28 points in the space of 12 truly incredible minutes to run out 42-38 winners. It was the first 21-point comeback in the fourth quarter of an NFL game in 12 years - in the in-between years, teams were 0-711 in such games.

Players diagnosed with ataxia during a game will not be allowed to return to the field. Tagovailoa was carried off the field last week when his head slammed into the turf as he took a sack during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Fans and armchair experts alike questioned why he was allowed to play against the Bengals as four days prior he looked disoriented after hitting his head to the ground during a game against the Buffalo Bills. Miami coach Mike McDaniel defended his decision to allow Tagovailoa to play against the Bengals, saying \"several layers of medical professionals\" had cleared the quarterback.

Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa \"could have died\" as a result of the mismanagement of a concussion, former rugby league player Stevie Ward has told Sky Sports. Ward, who was captain of Leeds Rhinos before he was forced to retire from rugby league at the age of 27 due to concussions he suffered on the field, said: \"We need to sit with the understanding that people are getting really ill, whether that's short-term or long-term.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"I saw that injury, the first one on the Sunday,\" Ward said. \"And the way that he got up, then stumbling to the floor - his team-mates holding him up, knowing it's not right - there's fundamentally something wrong. \"But then he's able to come back onto the field and test himself against the other team of prime athletes, who are all out to get him... and he plays four days later. \"He could have died.\"", "nfl-could-have-european-division-and-two-london-teams-suggests-commissioner-roger-goodell": "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has suggested that the league could introduce a European division while London itself could serve as the home to not one but two franchises.

Saquon Barkley put the Giants ahead for the first time in the game with six minutes left as he darted to the outside on a two-yard touchdown run to cap a drive he had exploded into life with a 41-yard reception. The Giants defense rounded off the comeback when Xavier McKinney batted down Aaron Rodgers' pass attempt on fourth-and-one with a minute remaining amid the Packers' efforts to draw level. First-year Giants head coach Brian Daboll moves to 4-1 on the season with the victory, while Green Bay slip to 3-2 after the first game in London between two sides with winning records. Barkley, the NFL's leading rusher, finished with 70 yards from 13 carries on the ground along with three catches for 36 receiving yards, having exited briefly for treatment on a shoulder injury in the fourth quarter. During his absence Giants back Gary Brightwell tied the score at 20-20 with a two-yard touchdown run with 10 minutes remaining to complete a 15-play, 91-yard drive. Green Bay led by 10 points at half-time through touchdowns from Allen Lazard and Marcedes Lewis, before Graham Gano made it a one-score game with a 37-yard field goal early in the third quarter. Rodgers was sacked by Dexter Lawrence for a loss of six on third-and-eight on the ensuing drive in what appeared to swing momentum in the Giants' favour. Darius Slayton led the Giants through the air with six catches for 79 yards after Big Blue had entered the matchup without Kenny Golladay, Kadarius Toney and rookie wideout Wan'Dale Robinson. Green Bay took an early lead through Crosby's 46-yard field at the end of a nine-play 49-yard opening drive that had seen Rodgers convert a third-and-eight situation with a 35-yard completion to Randall Cobb. The teams exchanged three successive three-and-outs until the Packers strengthened their early advantage with Lazard's four-yard walk-in score after McKinney had given up a 33-yard pass interference penalty while in coverage on Robert Tonyan. Gano puts the Giants' first points on the board with a 48-yard field goal as the Giants flashed signs of receiver separation early in the drive through Darius Slayton, who presented himself as his team's apparent splash-play option in the air amid injuries to their receiving core. Rodgers rounded off a 13-play, 75-yard drive with a gloriously-designed two-yard strike to Marcedes Lewis, the veteran tight end wide open in the end zone after a fake handoff to Aaron Jones and a defense-dragging jet sweep decoy from Christian Watson. Rookie tight end Daniel Bellinger reduced the deficit for the Giants with a two-yard touchdown run on a reverse handoff from Barkley, who himself had ignited the series through a 40-yard burst out of the wildcat formation. Crosby made it a 10-point game at the break with a 48-yard field goal as time expired in the half. Packers head coach, Matt LaFleur: \"Obviously this is as disappointing as it gets for us. Give New York all the credit. They out-coached us, they outplayed us. \"They definitely wanted it more. It was the tale of two halves. They kicked our butt in the second half. You can't do that in this league. \"We just got to regroup. Everybody's got to look in the mirror and ask themselves what they can do better because it was a collective effort right there in terms of not being able to come out on top.\" Giants head coach, Brian Daboll: \"I think they play hard. They do what we ask them to do. They trust in the things we ask them to do. They work extremely, extremely hard. They played good situational football. \"I thought the quarterback (Daniel Jones) had an excellent game and he's had a few of those. Maybe his stats don't reflect it, but he's led his team down to wins. \"He's played good at crunch time coming back from a little bit of an ankle issue. I give credit to all the guys and all the coaches.\" Giants quarterback, Daniel Jones: \"I think we were aware that we were underdogs in the game. I think we realised that. But I think we're a motivated group. I think we are motivated to play for each other, to put our best stuff out there every time we go out there. So that's what's going to continue to motivate us and like I said we are going to continue to look what we can improve on.\" Packers quarterback, Aaron Rodgers: \"We got to handle adversity a little bit better. We're a little bit of a roller coaster team at times. Our best teams have been a little bit more steady. We got to find that rhythm, that steadiness. \"The biggest issue, again, I wish I had the perfect answer or explanation of this, but we haven't played consistent football in all three phases.

The 1-0 Baltimore Ravens are up 28-7 over the Miami Dolphins at the half. To start the fourth quarter, they are up 35-14. They cannot lose this game, right? Week Four. 2-1 Baltimore are up 20-3 over the Buffalo Bills at half-time. Later, after a Buffalo fightback, the Ravens have the ball at the goal-line at 20-20 with just over four minutes remaining. Surely they can't throw away another game? Well, now it is Week Five and Lamar Jackson and company are 2-2, with question marks around coaching, their defense and Jackson's decision-making in last week's loss. If the Ravens were 4-0, or 3-1 - which they really should be - we would be discussing the electrifying quarterback's outstanding start to the season more. Let's do it anyway. In his 2019 NFL MVP award-winning campaign, Jackson was completing 66 per cent of his passes, had a 113.3 passer rating and was adding 80 yards per game on the ground on top of that. Through the first quarter of 2022, he is at 65 per cent and 105.1, with 79 rushing yards per game at a ridiculous 8.5 yards-per-attempt average. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He looks composed, poised and importantly supremely accurate as a passer, and ever-dangerous as a runner. There were question marks about Baltimore's receiving core - and they may remain throughout the season - but Jackson currently ties for the league lead with 11 passing touchdowns. The team have averaged 29.8 points per game so far, behind only the Detroit Lions and Kansas City Chiefs. There is no question the Jackson-led attack should be feared. So why are they just 2-2? While we can outline Jackson's successes and pick out all the outstanding things he has done so far, it is two crucial interceptions against Buffalo that stick in people's minds. A 3-1 start would have somewhat made up for the mess against Miami, but it has truly been a rollercoaster of a season so far for Baltimore. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In Week One, Jackson was putting the ball on the money. In a comfortable 24-9 victory over the New York Jets, the defense took care of business too against a Joe Flacco-led attack. Week Two saw their defensive deficiencies exposed. Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for 469 yards and six touchdowns. Both of Miami's top receivers - Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle - had 11 catches, over 170 yards and two touchdowns. To give up 42 points at home is extremely worrying, but the Dolphins have been one of this year's surprise outfits. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A 37-26 win over New England showed off the best of Baltimore, however, as Jackson accounted for five total touchdowns and the defense intercepted Mac Jones three times. Then there was last week's Buffalo disappointment, which likely hurt the most. They should never have thrown away a 17-point lead, however hard Josh Allen is to stop. But the offense also should not have been held to zero points in the second half. Jackson's interception came on a fourth and goal with the game tied. Head coach John Harbaugh should be in the spotlight for his decision not to kick a field goal, but Jackson's throw off his back foot and the subsequent Jordan Poyer pick meant rather than being forced to start at their own two-yard line, the Bills had some breathing room to start their game-winning drive. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Despite their knack for finding the end zone, they have not been able to keep opponents out of it. In years past, the Ravens have had fearsome defenses each and every campaign. That is not the case this year, as they have allowed 25 points per game (10th-worst in the NFL) and 425 yards per game (third-worst). It is not that simple though. On the flip side, and maybe even more importantly, they are tied for the league lead with 10 takeaways (seven interceptions and three fumble recoveries). We know this is an aggressive group that will aim for the interception or the strip sack rather than play it safe. If that gives the ball back to Jackson more often than not, that is surely a good thing despite giving up plenty of yardage. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For Jackson, it is about making the important plays when it matters the most - which he is more than capable of doing. If he continues at the pace, he is on course for over 40 passing touchdowns as well as over 1,000 yards on the ground. There is no doubt about his ability to lead an explosive offense. Ultimately, when the Ravens put it all together and get hot, they will be hard to stop. They host Cincinnati (2-2) on Sunday night, head to New York to face the 3-1 Giants in Week Six, then play Cleveland (2-2), Tampa Bay (2-2) and New Orleans (1-3) before their Week 10 bye.

Through five weeks, Wilson is averaging 250.8 yards per game passing, with just four touchdowns to three interceptions, while he is registering career-lows in completion percentage (59.4) and QB passer rating (82.8). With Wilson at the helm, the Broncos are 2-3 to start the season and boast the second-worst scoring offense in the NFL (15.0 points per game), beaten only by the Indianapolis Colts (13.8 PPG), who inflicted the latest of those three defeats on Wilson and the Broncos in eking out a 12-9 overtime win in a dreadfully poor Thursday night match-up. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wilson is a former Super Bowl winner with the Seattle Seahawks, but NBC Football Morning in America columnist Peter King fears the Broncos may already be regretting investing so much in the 33-year-old veteran. \"If I'm a Denver Broncos fan, or George Paton - the general manager - I'm starting to have a very sick feeling in the pit of my stomach,\" King told Pro Football Talk. \"'What did we pay for with Russell Wilson?' Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"This is not the Wilson we are used to from the first 10 years of his career. Through the first five weeks of the season, he is a mediocre NFL quarterback from what he is showing right now. \"That is the most alarming thing to me, the Broncos might have paid for a very flawed quarterback - and one who the Seattle Seahawks seemed smugly pleased to get two first-round and two second-round draft picks for [and Shelby Harris, Drew Lock and Noah Fant]. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  King added: \"If he continues on this trail for the rest of this year, it's going to be very hard for the Broncos. \"If Wilson in the next 12 games is what he has been through the first five weeks, I think you've got some serious thinking to do about what you do at quarterback in your future. \"They didn't know that they would be finding themselves in an emergency just one month into the season.\" Although the season is far from lost for the Broncos just yet, even their two wins this season failed to be convincing, as they beat the still-winless Houston Texans 16-9 in Week Two and edged out the San Francisco 49ers 11-10 in another turgid prime-time contest a week later. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  As well as Wilson, it has seen former Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator and first-time head coach Nathaniel Hackett come in for criticism due to the inefficacy of the offense and some early-season struggles with clock management. The team were roundly booed in the loss to the Colts on Thursday night, and Pro Football Talk presenter Mike Florio believes it might not be long until the Broncos ownership - the Walton-Penner family, led by Rob Walton, who acquired the team for a US-record $4.65 billion in June - decide to make a change. \"I would convene a meeting of the ownership and come up with the plan - all options on the table - to fix this,\" he said. \"They are going to take this seriously. They've got a fanbase that are already at their wits' end. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"It is their only priority to figure out what on earth is wrong with Russell Wilson, Nathaniel Hackett and what can we do to improve it?\" Florio added on Wilson: \"We don't see this from NFL franchise quarterbacks. Normally, once a guy shows that he is 'the guy', he continues to be 'the guy' until age or injury causes him to choose to no longer play. You don't lose it. \"I feel like Russell Wilson has just lost it and the harder he tries to get it back, it's not coming back.\" The Broncos travel to the Los Angeles Chargers in a Monday Night Football match-up in Week Six, before hosting the New York Jets and visiting the Jacksonville Jaguars in Weeks Seven and Eight ahead of their bye week. Wilson has placed the blame for the Broncos' struggles firmly on his own shoulders, and had promised to turn the team's fortunes around. \"It's very simple. At the end of the day, I have to be better. I have to play better,\" he said after their latest loss. \"The good thing is that one thing I know about myself is [that] I'm going to respond.

Daboll enters Sunday's matchup with the Green Bay Packers 3-1 after succeeding Joe Judge as head coach this past offseason following four years as Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator. After five straight losing seasons for the organisation, the former Bill Belichick and Nick Saban mentee inherited a team in dire need of direction. The early signs have been encouraging. \"I love their culture right now and Brian Daboll has brought that culture,\" said Bell, who previously spent time with the Giants. \"They have great ownership, but the leader is the coach and what he's doing and what he's bringing is allowing these players to be themselves on and off the field and that's very important. \"They have their identity. People weren't sure what the identity of this team was going to be, but they have it. \"Saquon Barkley is running like a man on a mission and of course I'm biased to the New York Giants, I want them to come out here and flat-out ball out. \"With Brian Daboll they're in good hands because of him and his creativity as an offensive play-caller, but also a leader.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Big Blue's bright start to the campaign has been built on a rejuvenated Saquon Barkley, who leads the league in rushing yards and appears to have rediscovered the one-step explosiveness of his rookie year, along with an exotic Wink Martindale-inspired blitz-heavy defense. A contract year for quarterback Daniel Jones has seen his receiving core marred by injury thus far, with 2021 marquee free agent addition Kenny Golladay, second-year Kadarius Toney and rookie Wan'Dale Robinson all out of Sunday's game. Richie James is tied first on the team with Barkley in catches (15) and leads the Giants in receiving yards (155), while Jones himself has 193 rushing yards for two touchdowns from 31 carries. Left tackle Andrew Thomas is currently PFF's highest-graded player in the entire NFL, though the Giants offensive line as a unit remains a work in progress having surrendered 14 sacks so far this year as rookie right tackle Evan Neal adjusts to life in the pros. \"It's been a struggle, the protection has been a little tough for him and with the receivers it's been a struggle but he can create with his legs,\" added Bell. \"One thing I love about Daniel Jones, it's hard to be the quarterback in New York, but he makes no noise, he just goes on the field and tries to lead this team however he can. \"I think if he can still move around and be effective with his legs running the ball, with Saquon Barkley, that's a two-headed monster and hopefully they can gain enough yards to get a win.\" Daboll's role in the transformation of Bills quarterback Josh Allen was among the chief selling points upon his arrival in East Rutherford, the hope being that he can have a similar impact on Jones in what is a potential make-or-break year for the former first-round pick. The Giants play-caller, while short of proven receiver options, is 67 of 105 passing (63.8 per cent) for 631 yards and three touchdowns to two interceptions so far this season, and enjoying life under Daboll. \"He's been great for me, having an offensive-minded head coach has been fun as a quarterback and learning the game from his perspective,\" Jones said of Daboll on Friday. \"He's been around the game for a long time, been an offensive coordinator for a long time at several different places and had a lot of success. \"He's had a lot of experience to share and I've learned a ton from him. I think his system is one that fits us well as a team, it gives us a lot of options, it allows us to move guys around and get guys in different spots and do what they do best.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Jones is primed to start at Tottenham after nursing a sprained left ankle he suffered during last weekend's win over the Chicago Bears. In doing so he has seemingly earned respect from his teammates. \"He's a tough dude, that doesn't surprise me,\" said defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence. \"It makes us want to play for each other more knowing that we are all nicked up a little bit, we all are hurting a little bit, but we're all fighting for each other and fighting for a win. \"It pumps you up a little bit showing that your brother is fighting for you even though he's wounded. Just always have his back, and the way you have his back is doing your job and playing well.\" Barkley added that it \"speaks volumes\" when a team's quarterback shows a desire to play through discomfort as Jones has this week.

Awaiting them will be one of the UK's largest NFL team fanbases, such is the franchise's celebrated history. \"One of the first franchises, right,\" said Bell. \"The Lombardi Trophy, the championship trophy is named after their coach.

In a low-scoring contest in which both offenses showed why they're currently ranked last (Colts) and third-last (Broncos) in the NFL in scoring, Chase McLauglin's four field goals - including a game-winning 48-yarder in OT - ultimately proved the difference. Gilmore also intercepted a Wilson pass in the fourth quarter - on third-and-4 from the 13-yard line, intended for Jerry Jeudy in the endzone - to help set up McLauglin's game-tying field goal from 31 yards with five seconds left. The Colts won the overtime coin toss and Ryan drove them into field-goal range again, but Wilson had the chance to win the game for the Broncos with a TD on the subsequent drive, only for Gilmore to again come up with the crucial intervention - this time the veteran cornerback batting his pass away. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It's the first game in NFL history that pitted two quarterbacks together with at least four Pro Bowl appearances each, but to feature zero touchdowns. Matt Ryan was 26 of 41 passing, for 251 yards, as he grinded out the victory for the Colts (2-2-1) despite throwing two interceptions into the hands of safety Caden Sterns, fumbling for the 10th time this season and getting sacked six times, taking him to 21 on the year so far. Russell Wilson went 21-for-39, for 274 yards and two interceptions as the Broncos (2-3) lost a second straight.

A snoozy sentiment was shared, tossed around as small-talk and somewhat welcomed along the sideline at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday, where media had gathered to watch 44 NFL hopefuls from 13 countries compete in the 2022 International Combine. Bell has answered as many questions about the league's growth overseas as anybody in recent years, indeed re-modelling and upgrading his responses on an annual basis such has been the progress. The return of the Combine to London for a second successive year was the newest evidence of as much, Tottenham having become the luxury holiday home the NFL once dreamed of acquiring and now boasts of visiting each autumn. By now, they need not knock on the door before entering. \"It's International month! The NFL owns this month out here and this is why I love it,\" Bell told Sky Sports. \"Everything that's happening now is what we've envisioned, non-stop NFL action, things going on for the entire month between games. \"I'm so excited to be out here, I can't get enough of this. I love everything around it, I'm so honoured to be part of it. \"What you're witnessing in this country and growth of the game comes down to the hard work of the NFL UK and NFL International, but it's the fans, it's their love, their appreciation, without them none of this would happen.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The former defensive back, admittedly \"exhausted\" after Sunday's thriller between the Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints, swiftly retracts a suggestion he wishes he was on the field taking part in the series of exercises designed to highlight the top athletes. On the surface, the NFL's touchdown in the UK is a lit up Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, a South Bank festival of football and double-doink game-day theatre; beneath it lies the pursuit of international talent, once-thinkable opportunity and a better future, be it through the Combine, the NFL Academy or the NFL Foundation UK. Tuesday was, among others, about British edge rusher Arthur Mbahin, who was born and raised in Cameroon until the age of 10 and only discovered football by way of a trip to Houston to see his uncle in 2012. \"When I first came back here I didn't know they played it here so just came back and was playing Madden, watching it on YouTube,\" he tells Sky Sports. \"The first year in the uni sports fair I saw American Football and was like 'let me get into it'. Before I was doing track, I went to uni and was like 'let me switch it up', I was tired of 400m training because that's a lot. \"But the fees, we have to pay to play so the fees didn't allow me. I went home, decided over the summer holidays to save money, came back and they increased the fees again, then I came back in the third year and they increased the fees again.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It was not until 2019 that Mbahin finally began playing football thanks to help from one of his coaches at Coventry University, since playing for which he has also spent time with the Leicester Falcons and Tamworth Phoenix. As far as reference points go, his film study began with the greatest defender to ever do it. \"The first player I got introduced to was Lawrence Taylor, watching The Blind Side, it wasn't about Lawrence Taylor but if you watch the introduction they mention that Lawrence Taylor made the left tackle popular so I started watching Lawrence Taylor,\" he adds. \"Then I've watched guys like Myles Garrett, Aaron Donald, Jadeveon Clowney, I look at people like my stature. From the beginning I'd turn the TV on and be 'this guy looks like me so I'm definitely playing that position'.\" Mbahin was one of five players representing the UK at the Combine alongside Bristol Aztecs linebacker Emmanuel Falola, London Blitz edge rusher Jai Jackson and London Warriors running backs Tyrese Johnson-Fisher and Andy Owusu, all of whom are striving to emulate Adedayo Odeleye and Ayo Oyelola after the British duo came through last year's International Player Pathway to earn spots with the Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars, respectively. The Combine, meanwhile, showcased the NFL's continued expansion in Africa as offensive lineman Chijioke 'CJ' Basil Okoye represented one of 12 Nigerian players in attendance on behalf of Uprise Academy, a program overseen by two-time Super Bowl champion and New York Giants legend Osi Umenyiora. \"In Nigeria we don't have football but we like football, we just channel the energy to basketball,\" says Okoye. \"It's been a long journey. \"When I first met Osi he was good, kind, I did know what to expect from him, the love he showed, he wasn't holding back.\" Their involvement comes on the tail of countryman Roy Mbaeteka, though since released, signing with the Giants after participating in last year's Combine despite having never played football in high school or college. Okoye, who notes how he likes to study San Francisco 49ers tackle Trent Williams, won MVP at Umenyiora's NFL Africa camp earlier this offseason and again showcased his basketball-cultivated footwork and speed in Tuesday's drills. As was the case for many, the chance to be in the UK alone proved beyond imagination. \"In the UK the hospitality is great, I love it but the weather is a bit chilly,\" he jokes. \"I've dreamed of being in the UK but it's exceeded my expectations. I like it here. \"My mum, she was like ‘Oh I don’t know, can you do this?’, but my family have been supportive. I didn’t believe I would be in the UK today, I’m happy and I know they’re happy for me.\" Little over a month out from the NFL's first ever regular season game in their home country, offensive lineman Leander Wiegand and defensive end Flamur Simon of the Cologne Centurions featured among six German players invited to take part. Wiegand began playing football with the Aachen Vampires and earned himself a NCAA D1 scholarship at the University of Central Florida, where he spent a season before returning returning to play for Cologne. \"I remember watching the Super Bowl,\" he said of his earliest memory of the NFL. \"My friend told me about it, I didn't know anything about football but there was Cam Newton and they lost but he did this [acts out Newton's Superman gesture], then later I watched the highlight tape from JJ Watt and I was so impressed, I knew that's what I wanted to do.\" Nowadays he says he is sitting down to watch Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackles Tristan Wirfs and Lane Johnson, while also being a Williams fan. \"I watch Trent Williams, he's on such a level that you can't really copy,\" he says. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For Simon, Buffalo Bills generational edge marvel Von Miller became a natural role model from whom he takes notes on a Sunday. \"I'm a Broncos fan, unfortunately he isn't on the Broncos anymore but I still follow him, he's one of the most impressive athletes I've ever seen, in not only football so I like to try and see if I can replicate anything from him,\" he said. Simon's first introduction to football arrived during the sport's first season live on free-to-air TV in Germany, which prompted himself and a friend to later sign up for a team in 2016. The 22-year-old registered 76 tackles, five sacks, 12 tackles for loss and two interceptions for the Centurions last season and was previously offered a scholarship by D1 University of Massachusetts. \"I'm proud to be here and to represent my country, it's a very nice look for the sport, for Europe to see this many countries represented and the types of athletes that are here are very well-mannered and good guys and good athletes, I like to compete against them and see how the top athletes from around the world look,\" he said. Both attest to the highly-touted German fan base that awaits when Tom Brady's Buccaneers travel over to face the Seattle Seahawks in Munich in November. Such was the level of interest that NFL analytics claimed three million tickets could have been sold for the game, hence their own struggle to lock down a seat in the Allianz. \"It's going to be crazy, when you look at how fast tickets sold out the stadium is going to be full and the whole hype in Germany is so big, especially because Aaron Donkor is at the Seahawks and from Germany,\" said Wiegand. \"Me and my friends had like several computers set up and right at the time we tried to get tickets but we were like 600,000th in line, we tried,\" conceded Wiegand, before issuing a light-hearted plea for any fans with extra tickets on offer to send them his way. Every so often the pair's eyes divert around the arena in which neither one can quite believe they have just played and in which just days earlier Justin Jefferson had been running riot for the Vikings. \"Sunday we watched the game and now we're there competing to be in it on a future Sunday, it's amazing. It hasn't really gotten to me,\" said Wiegand. Regardless of whether or not a place in the final IPP program awaits, the experience has only seemingly fuelled their love for the game. \"It's a dream, it's a long shot, but when you look at the stage I cannot imagine anything else that would be better for me as an athlete and as a person to achieve something like playing in a stadium like this,\" added Simon. It is now a waiting game for the athletes involved as the NFL searches for its next Efe Obada or Jordan Mailata.

A few days after I'm still buzzing from the way it ended and the incredible atmosphere in the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. I've been lucky enough to be on the sidelines for a few of the International Series games in London now, and I can safely say that was the most entertaining, back-and-forth contest I've witnessed. We had sacks, interceptions, questionable flags, we had 'the Griddy', a 60-yard field goal and even a double-doink! We really couldn't have packed much more into it, could we? Side note: from my 'reporter position', I could only see the first doink, which looked like it was doinking over the bar, so for half a second I thought we were going to overtime. Which was fine by me, but fear-inducing to the rest of the Sky Sports NFL crew who were already in for a three-game, 12-hours-on-air marathon of a day. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It really was the perfect start to this year's International Series which will see a total of five games played outside of the US: three here in the UK this month before the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks face off in Munich in November, with the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers headed to Mexico City later that same month. We also find ourselves a quarter of the way through the 2022 season. Yep, really. Only the Philadelphia Eagles remain unbeaten, the Miami Dolphins top the AFC East, the Jacksonville Jaguars lead the AFC South, and four divisions don't have a single team with a winning record. In fact, 15 teams are 2-2 through four weeks of the season, the most teams with that record ever at this stage of a season in NFL History. Have we finally achieved parity in the sport? Maybe. We've had 50 one-score games in the fourth quarter so far this season, with only the Kansas City Chiefs having greater than a one-score lead in the final 15 minutes of the matches this last weekend.

Five things to look out for in Week Five... The Green Bay Packers are in London baby! For the first time ever, Green Bay are making the trip across the pond, becoming the 32nd and final team to play here in the UK. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Not only are the UK Packers faithful finally getting their dream come true, for the neutral it's also a tantalising prospect: with the arrival of Aaron Rodgers, it's the first time we've seen the reigning MVP start a game in London. Their opponents, the New York Giants, lead the NFL in rushing thanks to the long-awaited resurgence of Saquon Barkley and the rush defense is a real weakness of the Packers'. Passing is a whole other ball game (pun intended) so this is set to be a fascinating tussle in Tottenham. Kenny Pickett came in for Mitch Trubisky in the Pittsburgh Steelers' four-point loss to the New York Jets on Sunday and has since been named as the Steelers starter ahead of a difficult four-game run that sees them first play the Buffalo Bills, then the Bucs, Dolphins and Eagles. A baptism of fire as a starter which arguably comes with low expectations. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Pittsburgh are on a three-game losing streak and there's absolutely no harm in getting the rookie in now for some game experience in what is very much a mulligan of a season. Let's just hope that Bills defense doesn't destroy his confidence straight out of the gate. Meanwhile, Blake Bortles has officially retired after an eight-year NFL career having earned $48 million, getting his team to an AFC title game in the 2017 season. He played 78 games and threw 75 interceptions (make of that what you will); while Cam Newton is rumoured to be trying out with the Washington Commanders, with the team concerned about how Carson Wentz has fared through four weeks. It was flea-flicking, pirouetting brilliance from Patrick Mahomes against the Bucs on Sunday night, and he now heads into a matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders where Patrick Mahomes is 7-1 throughout his career. Sure, he plays them twice a season, so the numbers are naturally inflated, but the passer rating doesn't lie and Mahomes is 112.4 against the Raiders. That's really good. Like, really, really good. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  I know that 'Patrick Mahomes is a good quarterback' is no hot take but I refuse to let his level of talent become a thing we don't celebrate on the regular. He'll get a ton of points (both real and fantasy) against a Raiders defense with a seeming inability to sack a QB and we should all take a moment to enjoy the spectacle. Naturally, there has been a huge amount of discussion regarding Tua Tagovailoa, the concussion protocol and general player safety over the last 10 days. It's a bigger topic than I'm qualified to dive into, but suffice to say the review of player safety and concussion protocol must be, and looks like it will be, rigorous. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Additionally, it was utterly remarkable to see J.J. Watt reveal that he had been treated for Atrial fibrillation (when the heart is beating too quickly, too slowly, or irregularly) last week before then playing for the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. Now, obviously, Watt wouldn't have taken to the field without medical clearance, but given his emotion in the post-game news conference it was impossible to not think of just how much these players risk week in, week out, and the toll it takes physically and emotionally. I won't lie I started this article writing \"Four things to look out for in Week Four\", having been so swept up in the fun of a London Game week I completely lost track of where we were in the season. As a result, I don't have a fifth point here, other than to let you know I'm in full fan mode on Sunday for Giants vs Packers, so say hello if you're there! Buoyed by the fact that I'm 4-0 in our Sky Sports league (which I was attempting to keep cool about, but that's ultimately not my style - GO ME!), I'm feeling entirely overconfident when it comes to Fantasy Football. Further boosted by a smart Waiver Wire pickup of Nyheim Hines, history indicates that it really will all fall apart this week, but in the meantime... Caleb Huntley of the Atlanta Falcons (yep, until five minutes ago, I didn't know the name either) is a wise pickup with Cordarrelle Patterson out, you wouldn't be entirely bananas to consider Geno Smith as cover at QB with bye weeks approaching (available in almost 80 per cent of leagues) and Josh Jacobs owners should proceed with caution ahead of his trip to Kansas City - the Chiefs defense is number one in the NFL against the run.

Miller has a massive 118.5 career sacks, placing him 22nd on the all-time list, since being taken with the No 2 overall pick of the 2011 NFL Draft. Having secured a second Super Bowl title of his career with the Los Angeles Rams last season, following on from being named MVP in his prior win with the Denver Broncos to cap the 2015 season, Miller has started a new chapter in Buffalo, penning a six-year, $120m deal in the offseason.

His resume is his resume. Kudos to Von Miller. Tip of the cap to Von Miller.'' That resume of Miller's includes those two Super Bowl victories, to go with eight Pro Bowl selections and three All-Pro nods. Tomlin coached Miller in one of those Pro Bowls at the conclusion of the 2017 season. Miller racked up three tackles, a sack, a fumble recovery, two QB hits and a defended pass as he was named Defensive MVP in the game. \"I spent a week with him in Orlando when we coached the Pro Bowl and just to see the professional and scientific approach that he takes to his craft, even in a setting like that, that guy was the reason we won that game,\" Tomlin said. \"I know we don't spend a lot of time talking about the outcomes of Pro Bowl games, but Von Miler took over that one and gave us all quality checks.

Ward, who was captain of Leeds Rhinos before he was forced to retire from rugby league at the age of 27 due to concussions he suffered on the field, said: \"We need to sit with the understanding that people are getting really ill, whether that's short-term or long-term.\" Tagovailoa was stretchered off the field and taken to hospital with head and neck injuries during the Dolphins' defeat to the Cincinnati Bengals last Thursday night, four days after the quarterback had been shaken up and looked wobbly on his feet in a game against the Buffalo Bills. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tagovailoa left the field with what was initially described by the Dolphins as a head injury before subsequently returning to the game. He was then listed as 'questionable' ahead of Thursday night's game, said to be suffering from a sore back and ankle injury, before being cleared to play. \"I saw that injury, the first one on the Sunday,\" Ward said. \"And the way that he got up, then stumbling to the floor - his team-mates holding him up, knowing it's not right - there's fundamentally something wrong. \"But then he's able to come back onto the field and test himself against the other team of prime athletes, who are all out to get him... and he plays four days later. \"He could have died.\" Ward added: \"I don't think this is just a concussion issue; it's the management of concussion. To go even further than that, it's about the management of people. It's a respect thing. \"I don't think he was treated as a person. He was treated as someone that they just wanted to get back on the field. \"And, as a player, you feel like you are invincible. All that you train to do is get back out there and play.\" Tagovailoa was released from hospital that evening and flew back to Miami with the team, but he's been ruled out of their Week Five game against the New York Jets this Sunday with a concussion, with it not yet known when he will be able to return to action. He has spoken to representatives from the joint NFL and NFL Players Association investigation into his concussion, with the findings from the investigation are to be released to the public. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, who was on the opposite sideline watching on as Tagovailoa was stretchered off the field, said on Wednesday that head injuries are just a part of playing in the NFL. \"You're going to have head injuries,\" told The Colin Cowherd Podcast. \"You're going to tear your ACL. You're going to break your arm. That's the game that we play. \"That's the life that we live. And we get paid handsomely for it. I think going into every game, we know what we're getting ourselves into.\" Burrow added he was familiar with concussion-like symptoms, despite not having been officially diagnosed with a concussion since entering the league as the No 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. \"I've had some where I don't remember the second half or I don't remember the entire game or I know I got a little dizzy at one point,\" Burrow said. \"But nothing long-lasting.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Burrow described Tagovailoa's injury as \"scary\" in the immediate aftermath of their Thursday night game, adding \"it's a dangerous game and something like that can happen at any time.\" The third-year quarterback's most significant injury occurred as a rookie in 2020, when he tore the ACL and MCL in his left knee and required season-ending surgery. Burrow said there are inherent dangers that come with playing the game, adding on the podcast: \"You have 300-pound men running 20 miles an hour trying to take your head off while you're standing still, trying to ignore it and find receivers that are open.\" On Saturday, the NFLPA dismissed the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant (UNC) involved in Tagovailoa's concussion check during the Bills game on the basis of \"a failure to understand his role as the UNC and hostility during the investigation\". Ward, who has said he suffers on a daily basis with symptoms caused by the concussions that ultimately ended his career, hopes Tagovailoa's injury can lead to greater knowledge of concussion and a change in approach to the management of them. \"The physical reaction he [Tagovailoa] had, the posturing, that was a tangible example of something for people looking on to go 'that's not right'. \"That happens all the time. He's the quarterback and so it's visible to everyone, but that will happen all the time to other players - getting back on the field and playing, when they shouldn't be. \"Who knows what the effects are going to be further down the line?\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He added: \"Things need to change. We need to suspend our emotion and desire to see the biggest hits and people playing after they've been concussed. \"We want a game that's physical, that makes us feel amazing - we get so many benefits from it - but we need to find that balance. Because no-one wants the game to go away. \"We need to find a way to get to a better management of concussion. This NFL example that we've seen is going to further the conversation. \"It's going to ask fans of the game and people who maybe don't think about it to think about it again.\" Addressing the Tagovailoa concussion on Pro Football Talk, NBC's Mike Florio said: \"When a guy has had an issue on a Sunday, should he be back playing on a Thursday under any circumstance?

The Cowboys (3-1) opened the season with a disappointing 19-3 defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a game in which they also lost their starting quarterback Dak Prescott to a fractured thumb. But in Prescott's absence, backup QB Cooper Rush has led the team on a sensational march, securing wins over the Cincinnati Bengals, New York Giants and, most recently, the Washington Commanders. Rush - who has become the first Cowboys QB in franchise history to win his first four starts, having also led the team to victory over the Minnesota Vikings in his solitary start last season - is expected to lead the offense again on Sunday, with Prescott's injured thumb \"not well enough\" for him to play, according to team owner Jerry Jones.

Tagovailoa remains under concussion protocol after he was sacked by the Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Josh Tupou on Thursday. He remained motionless on the ground for seven minutes before being stretched off the field and taken to the University of Cincinnati Medical centre for further evaluation. The Dolphins were criticised after the Bengals game because the 24-year-old had been suffering from a sore back and an ankle injury leading up to the match, seeing him listed as 'questionable' ahead of the game, prompting questions over whether he should have started. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tagovailoa had briefly left the field during Miami's 21-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills on October 2, following a hit by linebacker Matt Milano, with what was initially described by the Dolphins as a head injury. The third-year QB will miss this week's match against the Jets and coach Mike McDaniel said there is no timeline for his return. Teddy Bridgewater start in his absence, while Reid Sinnett was signed to the Dolphins' practice squad. McDaniel said Tagovailoa is spending time in the practice facility as he goes through the concussion protocol, and added that the quarterback's MRI came back clean. Tagovailoa was allowed back into the game in week three against the Bills, after he went off briefly with a head injury. The doctor who cleared Tagovailoa to return to the game was fired by the NFL Players Association. Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL's chief medical officer, said on Friday that Tagovailoa was checked for concussion symptoms every day last week before an independent neurologist cleared him to take the field on Thursday night against the Bengals. NFL Network reported on Tuesday that Tagovailoa is to speak to representatives from the joint NFL and NFLPA investigation into his concussion. The findings of the investigation will be released to the public. On Saturday the NFLPA dismissed the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant (UNC) involved in Tagovailoa's concussion check during the Bills game on the basis of a failure to understand his role as the UNC and hostility during the investigation.", "san-francisco-49ers-and-kyle-shanahan-lifted-by-return-of-veteran-coach-bobby-turner-ahead-of-los-angeles-rams-matchup": "A friendly, familiar, knowledge-filled face was greeted with open arms by the San Francisco 49ers this week as Bobby Turner made his return to the team ahead of Monday night's divisional clash with the San Francisco 49ers. The 73-year-old running backs coach, who started out at Indiana's Kokomo High School in 1972, distanced himself from football at the beginning of the offseason as he recovered from two surgeries, and had been due to miss the entire campaign only to fast-track his re-introduction. Turner has long been unsung as one of the masterminds whose expertise have contributed to the celebrated Mike and Kyle Shanahan wide zone offenses prevalent in NFL offensive schemes across the past two decades. He is as close to the evolution of the Shanahan system as anybody, and now re-enters the fold to impart further wisdom on a Niners offense still seeking a season-igniting spark. \"It's awesome having Bobby back. It's been weird not having him,\" Shanahan told reporters. \"He told me last year he was very clear, 'Kyle, I'm not retiring, I'm just taking a year off to get my surgeries, get healthy.' \"I've been talking to him and his wife over the last month or so. He was ready to come back. We saw him in Denver. It's awesome to get him out here. Got here two days ago and it's been great having him around.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Turner worked as running backs coach of the Denver Broncos for all 14 seasons of Mike Shanahan's reign as head coach from 1995-2008, and reunited with him in Washington from 2010-2013 as part of a coaching staff that had also included Kyle, now-Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur, now-Rams head coach Sean McVay and now-Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel. He later worked with Kyle Shanahan at the Atlanta Falcons from 2015 to 2016 before following him to California upon his appointment as 49ers head coach in 2017, the pair having since orchestrated one of the most innovative and multi-faceted run games in the NFL. It was only natural for his brief absence to leave something of an unusual hole. \"It was really weird for me,\" said Shanahan. \"I have little things I always mess with Bobby on. Anytime I have an awkward time in a meeting, I just make a Bobby T joke or call him out on something and we kind of just make everyone laugh and not having him there has been awkward. \"I always start with every meeting, addressing him, stuff like that. So just things that you get used to that. For me, it started for all those years in Washington I was with him and then same thing with Atlanta and being here with him the last five years, so it's a really nice to get him back.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Former Los Angeles Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn is the current 49ers running backs coach, though Shanahan says Turner's experience and knowledge remains applicable to the entire roster. \"Just helping in every way. I mean Bobby, he's been around a lot. He'll tell you he's been around about 80 years coaching,\" joked Shanahan. \"I think it's 45, but no, we got a great running backs coach in Anthony [Lynn]. \"Anthony who was coached by Bobby, so their relationship is great. They got a lot of love for each other and I just like Bobby coming around and getting on everybody on every little detail the way he does, so it's not just the runners, it's the receivers, it's the quarterbacks, it's everybody. And I think everyone's glad to have Bobby in here.\" The 49ers are currently slim at running back heading into their Week Four matchup following injuries to Elijah Mitchell and Ty Davis-Price, while lane-clearing left tackle Trent Williams is also sidelined with an ankle issue. It leaves Jeff Wilson, who had 12 carries for 75 yards in last weekend's 11-10 defeat to the Broncos, as the lead option out of the backfield alongside the all-purpose role of self-titled 'wide-back' Deebo Samuel. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Jimmy Garoppolo will start under center again following the loss of second-year quarterback to a season-ending ankle fracture, while George Kittle plays his second game of the campaign as a chief upholder of the Niners ground game. Monday marks the first time the teams have faced off since the Rams edged out the 49ers in last season's NFC Championship Game on their way towards winning Super Bowl LVI with victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. The Rams arrive looking to snap a seven-game regular-season losing streak in the matchup.

Mahomes had all the answers for solving Tampa Bay's stingy defense, winning his latest matchup against Tom Brady in the stadium where the seven-time Super Bowl winner dealt him one of his most disappointing losses. Playing at a sold out Raymond James Stadium only four days after Hurricane Ian ravaged portions of Florida, Mahomes had TD throws of 16 yards to Travis Kelce, one yard to Clyde Edwards-Helaire and 10 yards to Jody Fortson while making NFL history by reaching 20,000 yards passing faster than anyone else. Edwards-Helaire and tight end Noah Gray rushed for TDs for the Chiefs (3-1), who won the first meeting between Mahomes and Brady since Tampa Bays 31-9 rout of Kansas City in the Super Bowl also played at Raymond James Stadium two seasons ago. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"When I came into the stadium I realised that I hadn't been here and the bad taste I had last time came into effect,\" Mahomes said. \"But it's still not a playoff game. It's a regular-season game, which is important. That Super Bowl will always leave a bad taste for me.\" The short pass to Edwards-Helaire was Mahomes at his improvisational best: He escaped two defenders, did a 360-degree spin move and flipped the ball over a crowd to the running back in the back of the end zone. \"I was able to use my speed, my little bit of speed, to get around the edge there. I was gonna run for it, but they kind of flew around me,\" Mahomes said. \"I realised I wasn't going to make it and I saw Clyde, so I kind of flicked it up to him.\" Brady noted it's fun watching Mahomes, unless he's on the opposing sideline. \"I love seeing Patrick play. Unfortunately, we're on the wrong end of it tonight,\" said Brady, who's 1-2 against the Chiefs quarterback since joining the Bucs in 2020 after two decades with the New England Patriots. Brady completed 39 of 52 passes for 385 yards and three TDs without an interception for Tampa Bay (2-2). The Bucs, however, played from behind the whole night after rookie Rachaad White fumbled the opening kickoff and Mahomes threw his TD pass to Kelce two plays later. The Chiefs also got into the end zone on three of their next four possessions, with Mahomes repeatedly shredding the Tampa Bay defense with pinpoint passes and Edwards-Helaire and Isiah Pacheco taking turns running the ball effectively. \"It's a team sport. We didn't play great on offense. We didn't help (the defense) much, either,\" Brady said. \"We didn't do great in the first half. Too many missed opportunities on third downs, turnovers. We gotta play a lot better to be one of the good teams, the seven-time Super Bowl winner. We havent' played our best yet this year.\" Chiefs cornerback LJarius Sneed sacked Brady, forcing a fumble that Mahomes turned into Grays TD, with the tight end taking a direct snap from center on the 1-yard plunge that put Kansas City up 28-10. Brady threw TD passes of 13 yards and 1 yard to Mike Evans, who returned from serving a one-game suspension for his role in a on-field brawl at New Orleans two weeks ago. He had eight receptions for 103 yards. Evans' second TD trimmed Kansas City's lead to 28-17 at half-time. That was as close as the Bucs got until Leonard Fournette's 5-yard TD reception cut Tampa Bay's deficit to 41-31 with 3:30 remaining. Brady wouldn't get the ball back until less than a minute was left. Kansas City finished with 417 yards of total offense, including a 189-3 edge on the ground, against a defense that had allowed a league-low 27 points through three games. \"Everything in this game fell on the defensive side of the ball,\" Bucs coach Todd Bowles said. \"You name it we did it. Missed tackles. Missed assignments. Bad calls.\" The Bucs sacked Mahomes three times and intercepted him once, but it was not the coming out party linebacker Shaquil Barrett thought his team could have against an offensive line the Chiefs have overhauled since struggling against Tampa Bay in the Super Bowl loss. With Hurricane Ian approaching the Florida Gulf Coast, the Bucs evacuated for four days to the Miami area, where they practiced Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at the Dolphins' training facility while the NFL made contingency plans to move the game to Minneapolis if it couldn't be played in Tampa. The Glazer family that owns the Bucs has announced it is donating $1m for hurricane relief. The NFL Foundation is matching that donation, and the Bucs on Sunday night began a Florida Strong campaign to raise funds, as well as honor emergency personnel and first responders. Players and fans observed a moment of support prior the national anthem, and the Bucs also paid tribute to those affected by the hurricane in a video presentation displayed on giant scoreboard screens before the game.", "nfl-in-london-minnesota-vikings-edge-new-orleans-saints-28-25-in-thrilling-finish-as-will-lutz-misses-61-yard-field-goal": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Minnesota Vikings held on to beat the New Orleans Saints 28-25 in a thrilling finish to their NFL International Series game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London. In a rip-roaring, see-sawing contest which particularly came to life in the second half, the Vikings appeared to have put the game to bed when Greg Joseph fired through his fifth field goal of the contest to secure Minnesota a 28-25 lead with only 24 seconds left. But that was enough time for New Orleans to set up a kick of their own in the dying seconds, Will Lutz with the chance to take the game to overtime from 61 yards, having been successful from 60 less than two minutes earlier to tie the game at 25-25. Lutz's kick appeared to again have the distance, only for it to then agonisingly double-doink off the left upright and the foot of the goalpost to fall short and secure Minnesota (3-1) the victory. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Saints (1-3), meanwhile, lose their third-straight game to slip to the bottom of the NFC South and further behind early pace-setters the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-1). Kirk Cousins completed 25 of 38 passes for 273 yards and a touchdown for the Vikings, while Andy Dalton - starting in place of the injured Jameis Winston for the Saints - was successful with 20 of 28 throws for 236 yards and a TD. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Cousins and Alexander Mattison connected on a 15-yard touchdown to cap the first possession of the game and give the Vikings an early 7-0 lead, but both offenses otherwise struggled for much of the first half. After a Cousins interception, the Saints converted three third downs, the last of which - a four-yard touchdown pass from Dalton to rookie Chris Olave - tied the score. Otherwise, the scoring was left to the boot of Joseph as he kicked 28 and 36-yard field goals either side of a Dalton fumble to secure Minnesota a 13-7 half-time lead. After a third Joseph FG early in the second half, Dalton and Marquez Callaway teamed up on a 33-yard completion, leading to a Latavius Murray's goal-line TD that trimmed the Vikings' lead to two points, at 16-14. Minnesota then used a fake punt to convert on a fourth-and-2, leading to a fourth Joseph field goal, from 46 yards, but then Taysom Hill ran in for a two-yard touchdown - and Dalton found Jarvis Landry for a two-point conversion - to suddenly see the Saints up 22-19 with just under 10 minutes left in the contest. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Vikings regained their advantage as Justin Jefferson - who enjoyed a monster day, with 10 catches and 147 yards receiving - ran in a three-yard score, though this time Joseph was unsuccessful with an extra point attempt. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That miss allowed New Orleans to tie the contest courtesy of Lutz's monster 60-yard field goal, but there was enough time still for Joseph to atone for his earlier miss with a fifth FG and what ultimately proved to be the game-winner, with Lutz this time failing in dramatic fashion with another 60-yard try as time ticked away. Vikings running back Alexander Mattison: \"That game came right down to the wire. We just leaned on each other, trusted one another and the outcome swung our way. \"We got that [Vikings] SKOL chant going; they were really loud for us, it's a beautiful thing. We love it here in the UK, they came out big for us.\" Saints head coach, Dennis Allen: \"Frustrating way to end that game. We had our chances. Thought our guys battled back after the second half. We made too many mistakes in the first half, which put us behind. \"From where I was standing I thought it [Lutz's field goal] was going to be good. Obviously hit on the left upright and on the crossbar and bounced the wrong way for us.\" Former NFL defensive lineman, Londoner Jack Crawford: \"As a defensive lineman you hate when games go out of your control, it's never perfect, it's football.

Fact. Or certainly he has been since he entered the league as the 22nd pick in the 2020 Draft.  Jefferson leads the NFL with 3,262 receiving yards in the subsequent two and a bit seasons, picking up right where he left off in Week One of this campaign with nine catches, 184 yards and two TDs in a dominant display against the Green Bay Packers. Now, he and the Vikings take his talents to London as they face the New Orleans Saints in the first NFL International Series game of the season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday, live on Sky Sports NFL from 1.30pm (Kick-Off, 2.30pm). Speaking exclusively to Sky Sports ahead of the contest, Jefferson says his success is down to an unwavering confidence and mindset that \"no one can guard me\". \"That confidence I've always got to have, especially come game time,\" Jefferson said. \"I've had that ever since I was a little kid. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"On game days, that switch turns on and it's a whole different mode.

Head coach Matt LaFleur too conceded Jefferson \"wore us out today\". Justin Jefferson on Vikings' receiver history As many had predicted prior to the season, first-year head coach Kevin O'Connell - the offensive coordinator for Sean McVay's Super Bowl-winning Los Angeles Rams last season - seems to have provided the perfect scheme to showcase Jefferson's prodigious talents. It's set to be a partnership that will flourish over the coming years in the NFL, with Jefferson already waxing lyrical over what the new coach has brought to the team. \"It has been great,\" he said. \"KO [Kevin O'Connell] has been doing a great job with putting different plays in to try and get me open. \"Ever since he got here, it has been a relief - it has been great to have a head coach that connects with his players very well. \"We have been having so much fun just being around him; he is a great guy, great coach - we're definitely happy to have him on our team.\" That said, Jefferson has seen his targets and impact reduced over the last couple of games following on from that stellar opening against the Packers. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He has been held to only nine catches and 62 yards in Weeks Two and Three combined, with his 4.7 yards per reception in last Sunday's win over the Detroit Lions a career-low mark. \"It's definitely frustrating,\" Jefferson said. \"You don't want to finish a game with just three catches and a little bit of yards.

The game will mark the return of Jaguars head coach Doug Pederson to Lincoln Financial Field, where not so long ago he led the Eagles to their sole Super Bowl crown to cap the 2017 season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The rookie season of a quarterback warranting Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck-calibre commotion came burdened by a protruding Urban Meyer-shaped asterisk. Rather than parading, perceived generational talent Trevor Lawrence was answering questions from the media surrounding his head coach's mistakes, while being shoved in the firing line of an incompetent offense he somehow managed to look salvageable at times. Enter a proven professor to young quarterbacks in Doug Pederson, who in three games has done more for Lawrence and his development than last year's staff did in the 13 games Meyer was in charge. Lawrence enters Sunday 70 of 111 passing (69.4 per cent) for 772 yards and six touchdowns to one interception, ranking fifth in EPA/play with an upper tier release time, precision velocity and clinical field diagnosis in an offense sitting fifth in Football Outsiders' DVOA metric. A handsomely-paid receiver tandem of Christian Kirk and Zay Jones, the latter of whom missed practice on Friday, has re-introduced Duval and Lawrence to long-lost separation, while the Jags quarterback himself has thrown just one interception on the year and sacked just twice (tied-fewest with Patrick Mahomes) behind an improved offensive line. It is a new ball game and outlook for a play-caller that can go on to tick every box. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Did somebody say MVP? Surely not... or could he? Don't be silly... but maybe? There is no deceit to Jalen Hurts' early season return, which has seen him cash in on one of the NFL's most complete offenses and rosters by starting the year 66 of 98 passing (67.3 per cent) for 916 yards, four touchdowns and one interception alongside 167 rushing yards for three scores. For all the questions over whether he could be the driver of Nick Sirianni's offense, the 2020 second-round pick has gone out and bought his own personalised key ring and number plate. The athleticism and mobility in an RPO world that has become a necessity for young quarterbacks entering the league has been undisputed, and perhaps so too the arm strength. Above all, Hurts has taken a breakthrough leap as a pocket presence and coverage decipherer, helping him on his way to collecting NFC Offensive Player of the Month for September. \"Just the way he's kind of seeing the field right now,\" Sirianni said. \"He's identifying what's coming, he's knowing where to go with the football. His accuracy has been really outstanding. I think his numbers speak for itself, where we are at this point in the season. He's been on it.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Between a seemingly-unenamoured Meyer and a late-season Achilles injury, James Robinson's production declined in 2021 after a record-breaking rookie year that saw him amass the more scrimmage yards than any rookie undrafted free agent in league history. He teased signs of rediscovering that Draft-value-gazumping form on Sunday with 17 carries for 100 yards and a touchdown in the 38-10 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, marking his first 100-yard game since last season's Week Five defeat to the Tennessee Titans. Behind the production has been a return of the one-step cut conviction, self-trust and vision, along with the breakaway speed and agility that appeared to be hampered in year two. Pederson has taken a stale, lifeless offense and spruced it up with motion men, two or three tight end sets and spread-condense variation in view of generating run respect and production, while opening up the field for Lawrence and a more well-oiled menu of route concepts. Robinson and second-year back Travis Etienne, who missed his entire rookie year through injury, are trending towards an even share of the workload as keys to Pederson's impetus towards possession-controlling drives. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Tennessee Titans opted to trade away AJ Brown during this year's Draft in anticipation of the high-end contract he was hurtling towards and with the belief a golden age for college wide receivers could help compensate for his departure - I.E. Treylon Burks. It may be too soon to lodge a fair judgement on the logic or success of said approach, but so far this season the Titans' passing offense has stuttered while the Brown-rich Eagles are ranked fourth in pass DVOA and passing yards per game. Brown has 20 catches for 309 yards and a touchdown to his name after three outings, and suggested on 'The Crew' show this week he is already enjoying his football more in Philly. \"I got a lot of respect for Vrabel (Titans head coach Mike Vrabel), but he's the (Bill) Belichick way,\" said Brown. \"Over here, he (Sirianni) lets us have fun and do what we do. Let us express our personality.\" Receiving neighbour DeVonta Smith is meanwhile laughing in the face of queries over his slim frame by way of the playmaking instincts and unerring execution that fuelled his path to the Heisman Trophy in college. He has 15 receptions for 249 yards and a touchdown after logging a career-best eight catches for 169 yards and a score last time out against the Washington Commanders. The route running is poetic, the aerial command and control size-defiant. There had been an over-exhausted joke doing the rounds this offseason that Travon Walker was the least talked-about No 1 overall Draft pick of social media-juiced years gone by. He heard, and translated the stunting agility, alignment flexibility and selfless trap-laying of Kirby Smart's Georgia Bulldogs defense into disruption as an alpha to Mike Caldwell's athletic defense. He has jolted inside as a run-wrecker and bailed into coverage, pushed pockets with power and invaded backfields with first-step burst and slide. Fellow first-round arrival and Defensive Rookie of the Month Devin Lloyd has been just as impressive, if not even more impactful, with 24 tackles, six pass defenses and two interceptions as the Jags' next off-ball linebacker stalwart, the Utah product serving as an advocate for the three-cone drill with his instant change in direction and accompanying football IQ, with which he shuts down runners and sees through the cobwebs of crossing route disguises. The Jaguars defense sits third in EPA/play (-0.176) while coming out of Week Three fourth in Football Outsiders' defensive DVOA, a department in which they ranked bottom-five in each of the last three seasons. Their speed and fluidity against that of the Eagles offense ranked third in EPA/play is quite the matchup. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  During the Thursday Night Football broadcast, Tony Gonzalez, the greatest tight end in NFL history for some, referred to the Eagles' Dallas Goedert as the best tight end currently in the league. For some time that discussion has been governed by Travis Kelce and George Kittle, with Darren Waller and Mark Andrews throwing their hat into the ring and Kyle Pitts well on his way towards doing so, all of whom point to one another as the leader of the pack, such is the brotherhood that is the tight end community. Gonzalez dared to buck the trend, and you are intrigued to see how it plays out within a rampant Eagles offense led by a blossoming Hurts. Goedert has 11 catches from 14 targets for 168 yards and a touchdown so far in 2022, as well as being third in yards per route and first in tight end yards after catch in what could evolve into a breakout season, having had to wait three-and-a-half years for the lead job behind Zach Ertz. \"It was cool to be here behind Zach for a while but now it's my time,\" Goedert said recently. \"I want to take full advantage of it.\" Watch the Jacksonville Jaguars @ Philadelphia Eagles live on Sky Sports NFL this Sunday, with kickoff at 6pm following the New Orleans Saints against the Minnesota Vikings at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

It's quite the toss up for Kentavius Street when it comes to deciding on the better feeling. A predicament made even harder for the New Orleans Saints defensive tackle since the addition of exceptionally-named puppy 'Doodlebop' to the Street family. If anything, he can count on a wagging tail to be waiting for him when he returns from London, ideally with a sack and a win to his name, on the back of Sunday's clash with the Minnesota Vikings at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. \"I would say a sack, just because it's so rare and so hard to get, but coming home to my dog is a close second!\" Street tells Sky Sports. Compartmentalising life on and off the field has become an area of focus for Street as he learns more about the keys to thriving in the NFL, and the company of a furry friend, while perhaps trivial to some non-dog dads, has played its part in that. \"Those days where you just don't feel like doing anything and having that little companion there, there's nothing like it,\" he adds. \"I have two Shiba Inus right now and it's the best thing, they keep you on their toes because they're kind of like little kids but it's amazing. Just seeing how it brightens up their day when you walk through the door, it's just nothing like it, it's a really good feeling seeing how excited they are.\" Such is the nature of a self-admitted introvert, it would be easy to know little about Street besides his path as a 2018 fourth-round pick out of NC State for the San Francisco 49ers who saw his early career hampered by injury and who believes his best is finally primed to come to fruition having signed for the Saints this offseason. Ask a relative or a teammate for insight on the Street they know, and answers might range from goofy to geeky, most definitely \"always hungry\". A day in the life of Street typically begins with d-line meetings, film study and practice, before ending with him plotting his next and by no means last garage purchase. \"I'm getting to a point now in my career where I'm blessed to have the money I have so I'm becoming a little bit of a car collector and my niche is Japanese cars,\" he explains. \"Right now I have a Nissan Supra, a Maserati RX-7, I'm looking to acquire a Honda NSX, it's a really nice timeless car, it was made in the 90s I think. \"It's a beautiful car, I've just been obsessing about it, my screensaver right now for my computer, iPad and phone is that car.\" While it may not rival Brett Keisel famously arriving to Pittsburgh Steelers training camp in a dump truck, Street puts a 'if you know you know' tag on the Honda. There is a fun irony to a Street's car fad, at the dream tier of which sits a McLaren F1 he admits might have to wait until after he has retired. If all goes well, that should be a lengthy wait. \"It's a hobby I'm relatively new to, I've always had a thing for cars but I've never really delved into it but just having the resources I've got is just great to be able to feed that hobby - and sometimes it's bad! \"Sometimes it gets a little excessive so I have to control myself!\" The Japanese cars are merely a branch to a fascination with Japanese culture that stems from a childhood of watching anime series and researching the writers of his favourite shows to find out where they grew up. Here was the kid in him, maybe even the aforementioned geek in him. \"I ended up jumping into the cars, then once I got into the cars it was over with, I was just like 'nothing in Japan can do any wrong', I'm all for everything they do,\" he laughs. \"It's from what I've seen and how they carry themselves, it's a very safe and close-knit society and I think that's something the world can really benefit from. \"I think it's very rare, especially how busy modern day society has people, to have that close-knit family-type community in a lot of places I've seen in Japan I feel like that's something unique and something that made it a bond with me and Japanese culture.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He has even taken to studying how to speak Japanese, though admits language-learning app 'Duolingo' is \"not the happiest with me\" after a recent hiatus. For those unfamiliar, the app produces regular guilt-drenched notifications if users miss a day, as if a teacher telling off a child for forgetting their homework. \"It is very tough, oh my goodness. I've been off my game, I need to get back on it,\" he says. \"Not only do you have to learn how to pronounce everything and the slang in the language, but you also need to know the kanji and hiragana, they have different sets of symbols you have to be able to read. \"I've been trying to read anime with the Japanese sub-titles but it just happens so fast!\" His zest for interests outside the NFL have purpose aside from pure entertainment. Street believes discovering an identity separate to football has helped him within the game following a rocky introduction to the league that saw him manage just three appearances as a rookie after tearing his ACL. \"I think that's been the best thing I've done for myself these last two years of my career,\" he explains. \"The first two years of my career I was injured so I kind of just sulked at home, I didn't have any hobbies but towards the end of 2020 I really started to delve into cars and it really made a large difference in my life. \"I was really able to take the stresses that come with my career and be able to offset them with doing something I really love. I really think that not only made me a better person but a better football player, because I wasn't trapping all the emotional and physical stress that comes with playing football.\" If not geeking out, he is cooking out as an unashamed foodie who concedes he has to employ the same discipline he does with buying cars when it comes to limiting cheat days. The mastery and variety of New Orleans cuisine has not helped matters. \"I don't think there's any better place in the US to find food and explore food options,\" he jokes. \"Honestly the first 30 days I was here I gained 10 pounds so I had to lay off it, the food was too good!\" A self-reward for a sack, tackles for loss or any kind of productive game usually consists of cookies or a dozen doughnuts as somebody with a \"crazy sweet tooth\". \"I'll be on a game of Madden or 2K, FIFA, Grand Turismo, have a dozen doughnuts, a glass of warm milk and I go through all of them in like an hour and maybe get a double cheeseburger and some fries, really treat myself!\" he says. \"Then really try to burn it off the next day, like I need to run two-three miles to burn it off!\" From the food to the vibrancy of the Big Easy itself, it took Street no time to feel at home in New Orleans surrounded by a community devoted to the Saints and united by adversity in years gone by. \"I have felt it, something I've always said to people about playing sports in the south is that football is not a sport in the south, it's more like a religion, and people really really care about it,\" he said. \"I felt like that was something I kind of missed being in San Francisco. San Francisco's fan base is second to none but just being here is a different environment, people live and die by the Saints and their success and it's great to be around that. \"It pushes you to be a better player. It makes it that much easier to go and give it all on gameday because it's whole families out there that are so passionate and care so much about the game.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  On the field, he finds himself part of a new era of sorts for the Saints following the promotion of defensive coordinator Dennis Allen to head coach in the wake of Sean Payton's departure. Street currently plays a rotational role in a defensive line anchored by seven-time Pro Bowler Cam Jordan and Marcus Davenport either side of David Onyemata and Shy Tuttle. Allen's defensive units had ranked fourth in the NFL in yards allowed and scoring over the past three seasons, per ESPN Stats. \"Coach Allen is so passionate about defense and coming from San Francisco with an offensive minded head coach (Kyle Shanahan) you can really see the two extremes and it's really good,\" said Street. \"Coming here you can tell defense is everything and defense is on a premium and having that privilege to play on a defense that is so sought after and so much pride is put into it makes playing defense here that much more enjoyable because you know they selected you because you're the cream of the crop. \"I think it's really special. I think the sky is the limit for us, we have a few things we need to hammer out but it's a great experience.\" Between the team set-up and a hope that the personal setbacks are behind him, Street envisions himself being as happy as he has been in his NFL career so far. \"Most definitely. I'm so grateful to be past all the injuries I had in my past and to come down here to New Orleans and play in the time and setting we have here is so exciting,\" he continued. \"My old d-line coach from college (Ryan Nielsen) is down here, he's the defensive coordinator here and it's almost surreal. When he left NC State I was really down but now to play for him at a professional level is super special. \"A lot of things in life happen for a reason and for this to come full circle is just making not only the games we play in that much more special, but the season as a whole, it almost feels like a fairy tale at times.\" Watch Street's Saints take on the Minnesota Vikings live at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sky Sports NFL from 2.30pm on Sunday.", "patrick-mahomes-can-see-himself-following-tom-bradys-lead-and-playing-till-hes-45-years-old": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes says he wants to follow 45-year-old Tom Brady's example and \"play as long as I can\" as the pair prepare to face-off on Sunday Night Football, live on Sky Sports.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  'The Iceman' knows what it takes to win, he won this event two years ago, and then followed that up with a runner-up finish last year, ultimately losing out to fellow Welshman Jonny Clayton. He's coming into form nicely having, by his own admission, struggled with the schedule earlier on in the year. The world No 1 arrives in Leicester off the back of winning The World Series of Darts Finals, plus he missed last weekend's event in Belgium so should be feeling fresh! Compared to the other members of the 'Big Three' including Peter Wright and Michael van Gerwen, I think his section of the draw is slightly more favourable. He faces a debutant in Martin Schindler in the first round, and he knows what to expect there after their first-round tie in Blackpool! A tricky last-16 tie looms with either Masters champion Joe Cullen or Australia's No 1 Damon Heta but I expect him to get past either of those, with Rob Cross the highest seed in his quarter. Michael Smith and James Wade are in his half - we all know how dangerous Wade can be in this event having won it twice, but in five of his last seven appearances he's not made it past the opening round - so I'm backing Price to at least reach the final. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  …Danny Noppert! Now this might sound counter-intuitive because he's in the same half as Price!! But I think he can certainly make it out of his quarter. He did just that last year, in the end losing to Clayton in the semis and he could find himself with a similar scenario this time around with a different Welshman ending his chances. He looks more and more confident every time I see him on the stage and certainly since winning the UK Open earlier this year. He has such a calmness and steel about him, I'm a big fan of the way he goes about his business. We don't seem to talk him up too much ahead of majors, despite him picking one up this year! He's still flying under the radar with the bookies too at 25/1 but 'The Freeze' is one to keep your eye on! Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  …adds to the excitement!! Well it does for us anyway! Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For the players, the first round is a nerve shredder! The fact we start with best of three sets as well adds to the drama. There's no room for a slow start, last year showed exactly that with the likes of Peter Wright and MVG falling at the first hurdle. There's drama of the other kind too - we've seen players in the past step up on the stage and forget it's double-in and go straight for the treble 20! The fact we only see this format once a year adds a sprinkling of something special, it's unique, and a great leveller for the players. …Jonny Clayton vs Dirk van Duijvenbode! Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Is there any other answer?! To be fair there are some cracking opening ties but this is the standout for me. They've met a couple of times recently - at the World Series Finals which went the Dutchman's way, and then what a belter at the Belgian Darts Open over the weekend, both players averaged 105 but it was 'The Ferret' who came out on top then. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Clayton is the defending champion of course and is coming into form. He finished the Premier League top of the table but has admitted defeat to Joe Cullen in the play-offs knocked his confidence which took some time to recover from but he's certainly getting back to his best. Van Duijvenbode might not have won this event, but he came close a couple of years ago getting to the final and he's getting closer to winning something on the big stage.

Clayton will begin the defence of his title defence against high-flying Dutchman Dirk van Duijvenbode, while world champion Wright begins his bid for a maiden World Grand Prix crown against Kim Huybrechts. Clayton clinched his first televised ranking crown in last year's showpiece with a 5-1 demolition of fellow Welshman Gerwyn Price. The reigning champion will look to repeat those heroics in this year's 32-player tournament, which takes place at Leicester's Morningside Arena from October 3-9, with a record-breaking £600,000 prize fund on offer. Clayton is hoping to follow in the footsteps of 11-time winner Phil Taylor and Michael van Gerwen - who is chasing a sixth crown this year - by becoming only the third player in World Grand Prix history to retain their title. \"The double-in double-out format is challenging, but it separates the men from the boys,\" said Clayton. \"I'm going to turn up and play to the best level I can. If I play my best game, I've got a good chance of defending my title so that's what I will try and do. \"There are not many people that have defended the World Grand Prix and I'd love to join that list, so fingers crossed it's going to happen again.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Van Duijvenbode defeated Clayton at the World Series of Darts Finals in Amsterdam a fortnight ago, but 'The Ferret' gained revenge with a thrilling 6-4 victory at last weekend's Belgian Darts Open. Meanwhile, Wright will be featuring in his first televised ranking event since undergoing gallstones surgery in August, having returned to winning ways at last month's International Darts Open in Jena. \"I was really happy with the win in Jena,\" said 'Snakebite' Wright. \"I won it quite easily, beating some top players on the way through, so after the surgery it's all good.\"I feel confident about where my game is. I think I'm in the top four on the averages over the past few months, so if I can hit my double to start, I should be pretty dangerous.\" Wright, a runner-up to Michael van Gerwen in 2018, will be hoping to avoid a third consecutive first round exit in the double-start event when he takes on Belgian star Kim Huybrechts. The world No 2 is without a televised ranking title since scooping his second World Championship crown in January, and he is determined to add to his haul in Leicester. \"The World Grand Prix is definitely on my list,\" insisted Wright. \"I was practising for this tournament straight after the surgery. I said to myself that I've got to start on tops because it gives you the chance to get the highest start, so fingers crossed it works. \"Kim is playing well. He's in a good place and he's beaten me quite a few times recently, but this is double-start so it's a different playing field.

Van Gerwen recovered from a sluggish start in the final against Gerwyn Price to record a stunning 18-14 victory at Blackpool's Winter Gardens and claim the coveted Phil Taylor Trophy. The Dutchman was competing in just his second event since returning from arm surgery last month. The victory marked his first title at the Winter Gardens since 2016. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking to Emma Paton following the conclusion of the competition, Mardle hailed Van Gerwen's achievement and ranked it extremely highly compared to others in his career. \"It does [make it one of his best],\" Mardle said. \"I remember talking to Phil Taylor when he won here for the very last time and he couldn't believe he'd won. It was the most amazing win. \"When you win and you're the best player in the world - like Michael was from 2013 to 2019 - when you win you're expected to do that, it all comes very easily, or it seemed to come easily. \"When you really have to grind it out... he actually said before the final that he felt like the underdog, that's Michael van Gerwen talking!

Mardle believes there's still more to come. \"Michael van Gerwen has won this event, I'm going to say, not playing anywhere near his best,\" he said. \"That was Michael van Gerwen in his pomp scoring, but in his doubles 'No'. So, there's improvement that's possible. To not win a major for two years, he's reeled off two of the three biggest events in world darts. \"Maybe, these two [Price and Van Gerwen] will meet in the World Championship final!?

It just didn't happen for me today.\" Mardle also concluded that it didn't click for Price as much as the Welshman would have liked on the day. \"I do feel for Gerwyn because he didn't play well in the final but has had played well, especially in the quarter-finals and semi-finals but in the final, it just didn't go. \"He will be disappointed that he played like that and it wasn't poor, but it's all relative.

Never doubt a champion,\" he concluded. \"We've said it before, they find a way. They're different to us mortals, who find a way to lose.

Price seized the early initiative by hitting 180s in consecutive legs to lead 3-2, before registering an 11-dart hold and converting a 107 finish to win the next mini-session by the same scoreline. The 37-year-old then produced a blistering barrage to raise the roof in Blackpool, landing the magical nine-darter in leg 13 to become the first player in PDC history to land four TV nine-darters in a calendar year.

The two-time winner landed a 10-dart leg to restore parity at four apiece, and while 2020 champion Van den Bergh briefly restored his two-leg lead, he squandered two at double for a 7-4 cushion and Van Gerwen capitalised to level once more. The pair exchanged seven consecutive holds before the Belgian stole a march in a crucial passage of play, converting back-to-back 100 and 114 finishes to establish a 12-9 advantage. However, 'The DreamMaker' spurned two darts at double to move further clear in leg 22, and it proved to be an expensive miss, with the Dutchman winning four of the next five legs to draw level at 13-13. Van den Bergh registered his second 114 outshot of the contest - his fourth ton-plus finish - to retain his slender cushion, but he was unable to stem the tide in the latter stages. Despite missing double 11 for a 124 combination, Van Gerwen returned to pin the same target in leg 29 to secure the lead for the first time, before moving one leg away with a 14-dart hold. The pair traded 180s in a dramatic climax, but after Van den Bergh was unable to convert a 104 skin-saver, Van Gerwen closed out a 13-dart break to move within one match of a third title. \"It was a really tough game for me, but I stayed calm and I think from here, anything is possible,\" said Van Gerwen, who averaged 98.9 to continue his bid for a third Phil Taylor Trophy. \"I feel good.

'The Lancashire Rose' and Fallon Sherrock have dominated the Women's Series, but the arrival of 18-year-old Greaves to the scene will shake things up dramatically - especially with the expansion to 24 events for the 2023 season.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wright, wearing a hypnotic swirl-themed shirt and matching head paint, looked poised to breeze through to the last eight after storming into a 7-3 lead, converting 127 and 125 checkouts and firing in two 11-darters. Ratajski rallied, reeling off four consecutive legs to draw level at seven apiece, before defying a magnificent 10-darter from 'Snakebite' by landing back-to-back 180s en route to a 12-dart riposte. Nevertheless, 'The Polish Eagle' was staring down the barrel after squandering three darts to break throw and lead 10-9, with Wright leaving 16 after nine darts in the following leg. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  However, the world champion and world No 1 returned the favour by frittering away three match darts, and Ratajski capitalised, sinking a two-dart 77 combination to send the contest into overtime. The pair traded holds as the drama continued, although it was the Scot who kept his cool, following up his third 11-darter of the evening by pinning double 10 to triumph with his fifth match dart. \"I really enjoyed it,\" said Wright, who averaged 103.5 and landed 10 180s to set up a last-eight showdown against Van den Bergh, in a repeat of last year's final. \"You need to be in matches like that sometimes to see where you are. That has definitely got me ready for Dimitri now. \"Dimitri is playing really well. He has won two World Series titles recently, he's taken his game to the next level, so it should be another tight game. Bring it on!\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Van den Bergh recovered from a sluggish start to complete an 11-6 victory over debutant Rodriguez in Tuesday evening's opener. Rodriguez had pulled off a shock result to knock out Welsh No 8 seed Jonny Clayton in the opening round, but came up short against his friend Van Den Bergh. The 2020 champion, bidding to reach a third consecutive World Matchplay final, averaged 98.62, hitting six maximums, and landed a stunning 146 checkout to seal his victory and a place in the last eight. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"I have dreams that I am chasing. I'm loving it,\" said Van den Bergh, who converted 11 of his 18 attempts at double. \"Rowby is one of my best friends. He is a class player and he's finally showing what he can do. \"You cannot give these players chances. I want to improve because at the moment I don't feel like I'm playing fantastically, but I'm so working so hard.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Van Gerwen's hopes of a first World Matchplay title since 2016 are still alive, after he eased past a profligate Cullen to seal his spot in an eighth quarter-final at the event. The Dutchman was below-par in his opening round win over Adrian Lewis, yet he showed no signs of fragility in the early exchanges against Cullen in a repeat of the Premier League final, racing into a 4-1 lead with an imperious 111 average. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The pair traded four consecutive 180s in a remarkable fifth leg, and the high-scoring continued in leg six, as Cullen cut the deficit with a 12-dart break to double his tally. However, the Masters champion never recovered from squandering four darts at double to level proceedings, with Van Gerwen winning seven of the final nine legs to complete a comprehensive 11-5 success. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"I was on a mission. I started off really well and that gave me a lot of confidence,\" said the three-time world champion. \"I'm still not 100 per cent, everybody knows that, but even when I'm at 90 per cent, I can beat everybody in this tournament. \"This is one of the most important tournaments of the year. You want to perform here, and I'm so glad to be in the quarter-finals.\" Van Gerwen will take on Aspinall in the last eight, after the former UK Open champion produced an impressive late flurry to edge out 2007 champion James Wade 11-9 in a high-quality contest. Wade, fifth on the PDC Order of Merit, had started brightly, opening up a 2-0 lead with an early break before Aspinall, twice a World Championship semi-finalist, took the next four. There remained little between the pair, with 'The Machine' Wade gaining some momentum at 7-5 before a 13-darter from Aspinall tied the match again. A third maximum and 82 checkout saw Aspinall moving to within one leg of victory at 10-8 before finishing the job on his next throw. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"Every game I play is always a battle. James is a fantastic player. I knew it was going to be a tough game,\" reflected Aspinall, who was beaten by Van Gerwen at the same stage of last year's tournament. \"I really enjoyed it. I struggled in the middle part of the game, but I think my will to win got me through that in the end. \"I'm still learning all the time and I've learned a lot about my myself this week. I want to win it. I want this to be the year of the Asp.\" The second round draws to a close on Wednesday evening, as world No 2 Gerwyn Price continues his title bid against five-time quarter-finalist Dave Chisnall. Third seed Michael Smith meets Dirk van Duijvenbode in a mouth-watering tussle, while 2019 champion Rob Cross takes on former Grand Slam champion Jose De Sousa in another crunch clash. Elsewhere, UK Open champion Danny Noppert faces two-time TV title winner Daryl Gurney, twice a semi-finalist in Blackpool.", "world-matchplay-darts-gerwyn-price-dave-chisnall-jose-de-sousa-and-rob-cross-all-make-it-through": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Gerwyn Price, Dave Chisnall and Jose de Sousa all made it through at the World Matchplay in Blackpool as Rob Cross staged a stunning comeback from 8-2 down to win a thriller. Welshman Price began his quest for a first title in the seaside resort with a nervy 10-8 victory over Martin Schindler, while De Sousa wrapped up a 10-6 victory over Gabriel Clemens to reach the last 16 for a second consecutive year. Cross produced a remarkable comeback, recovering from 8-2 down to defeat Chris Dobey 11-9, and in the final match of the night, five-time quarter-finalist Chisnall inflicted more misery on Kim Huybrechts with a 10-7 victory. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  After a slow start from Price and Schindler, 'The Wall' landed a 141 checkout to break throw and level at 5-5. Determined debutant Schindler twice held his throw to lead 6-5 and 7-6, before 'The Iceman' struck back-to-back 11-dart legs to lead 9-7. Schindler kept fighting, taking out 91 to stay alive, but Price shut the door on the German with a 91 checkout of his own to book his place in the last 16. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"I think I put myself under a lot of pressure by letting him off early on,\" Price reflected \"Sometimes that's what I need to get myself going and I was playing some good darts by the end of the match. \"I've not been playing very well the last couple of months, as everybody knows, but today I came out fighting. \"I want to win this tournament and get back to world number one, back to where I think I deserve to be, but I'll have to come through a few tough games to do that.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Welshman will take on Chisnall in the second round after the five-time quarter-finalist showed his battling qualities to beat Huybrechts. On his first Winter Gardens appearance since 2018, 'The Hurricane' impressed and kept in touch with Chisnall in a game riddled with breaks of throw. With the scores level at 7-7, Chisnall held his nerve, winning the last three legs to deny his Belgian opponent what would have been a second World Matchplay win in eight appearances. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Cross, who produced one of the greatest comebacks in World Matchplay history in defeating Daryl Gurney en route to the 2019 title, was staring an early exit in the face as a fired-up Dobey hit two double 19s for a 92 checkout to lead 8-2. But Dobey was unable to see out a first victory on the Winter Gardens stage, as 'Voltage' reeled off six successive legs to level at 8-8. Dobey stopped the rot with an 11-darter, and with the Geordie waiting on 48 for the match, Cross pinned a skin-saving bullseye with his last dart to take out 74 and level once again. After Dobey missed a dart at tops, Cross once again found a last dart double, this time double nine, to go 10-9 up before keeping his composure with a 13-darter to seal an unlikely win. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"In the first 10 legs my darts were slipping, everything was all over the place,\" admitted Cross, who will face Jose de Sousa in round two. \"When I was 8-2 down, I stayed on stage during the interval and I knew if I could just produce a steady level, and stop him getting to nine legs, I had a chance. \"Chris missed a lot, he should've beaten me, but I've produced these comebacks before so I had the belief I could turn it around. \"This place [Winter Gardens] will always be special to me, I love it here so I'm really pleased to stay in the tournament.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  De Sousa, the world No 7 was the front-runner throughout the contest with Clemens, but was made to wait for the winning moment after a cruel bounce-out denied him a two double-tops finish on 100 for a 10-5 win. Undeterred, 'The Special One' landed his sixth 180 of the contest in the following leg before sealing the deal with his only ton-plus checkout of the match thanks to a with a show-stopping 136.

Dimitri Van den Bergh, the 2020 champion, takes on Rowby-John Rodriguez in the night's opening game, while 2007 winner James Wade takes on Nathan Aspinall. World No 1 Peter Wright meets Krzysztof Ratajski, before the final game of the night sees two-time champion Michael van Gerwen play Joe Cullen.", "world-matchplay-darts-michael-van-gerwen-muddles-past-adrian-lewis-as-joe-cullen-pulls-off-astonishing-10-2-victory": "Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Michael van Gerwen and James Wade muddled past Adrian Lewis and debutante Martin Lukeman respectively as Joe Cullen put on an astonishing performance at night two of World Matchplay Darts.  The headline match of the evening got off to a flier with Van Gerwen and Lewis both hitting the trebles well, 'The Green Machine' checking out on 126 on the opening leg to assert himself earlier on. Lewis, however, fought back to break Van Gerwen and led 3-2 at the first break. Despite an exciting start, the latter legs were sloppier, Lewis going bust on the 15th leg and providing the opportunity for Van Gerwen to go 9-6 ahead. 'The Green Machine' managed to get over the line with a 10-7 victory throwing his lowest average ever at the Matchplay and hitting just shy of 90. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For the Dutchman, there were \"no winners\" in his clash with Lewis but he knows how tricky the first stage can be at this competition. \"Yeah of course a win is a win at this stage of the game, first round of the Matchplay,\" said Van Gerwen. \"Most important thing is win your first game. It was tough for both of us, we both couldn't find our gear but I think my doubles were the key and helped me. \"I have to forget this game really quickly because there were no winners in this game to be fair. \"It was tough, it wasn't easy tonight but I am glad I got this one out of the way.\" In the opening match of the evening, Joe Cullen put on an astonishing performance against World Cup winner Damon Heta, winning nine legs in a row to take a 10-2 victory against the Australian. The stars aligned for Cullen as he set out to prove a point, taking out consecutive ton-plus finishes to put down the marker for his second-round opponent, Van Gerwen. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In a similar fashion to Van Gerwen, Wade saw out a scrappy encounter with Matchplay debutante Lukeman. Despite averaging below 90, Wade managed to power through and finish the match-up 10-4, Lukeman putting in a valiant display that fell down on his finishing. The final match of the evening session saw a stellar performance from Nathan Aspinall who blitzed himself to a 5-1 lead, leaving Luke Humphries unable to answer four maximums and four breaks of throw. Humphries managed to claw it back to 7-5 but Aspinall wouldn't go away and dismissed one of the three favourites to win 10-5 in a dominant display. The best encounter of the afternoon session came as 2019 runner-up Michael Smith faced off against Andrew Gilding in his first appearance at Winter Gardens since 2015. Gilding got off to a good start against 'Bullyboy', breaking him twice in the opening five legs but Smith fought back hard from 8-4 legs down to win 11-9, taking seven of the last eight legs to claim victory. He was naturally relieved after his performance and knows that, if he can maintain the performance he found for the last eight legs, he has the potential to win the tournament. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"The third session then I couldn't afford to lose a leg, especially being 8-4 down and luckily I got my act together and was hitting shorts and managed to scrape over the line,\" said Smith. \"I just couldn't find that first treble and I was looking for that first treble to follow it in and I was just so slow starting but managed to find it in the end and luckily tops was going in perfectly the whole match and managed to pull me out of the mud in the end. \"I have got the kids there and the kids pictures in my case and you have got to dig deep and show them that you can't give up.

When it is your day it is your day. \"Sorry to Andrew but someone has to win and luckily enough it is me. \"There are 32 players and you qualify on merit and you see I have been in finals this year and so I don't see why not. \"If I turn up and bring my A-game most people in the venue know there is only one winner so I just have to bring my game.\" The afternoon session opened with double Dutch delight as Dirk van Duijvenbode beat Ryan Searle 10-8 in a tense encounter, before Danny Noppert cruised past Brendan Dolan 10-6 after coming back to take six legs in a row for the victory. Next up saw Gary Anderson up against Daryl Gurney who, despite three ton-plus finishes for the 'Flying Scotsman', managed to grind out a 10-7 victory in a clash that saw six breaks of throw in nine legs. Anderson, who has struggled for form of late, couldn't find the trebles in the final few legs and succumbed to Gurney.

Defending champion Peter Wright, Dimitri van den Bergh, Gary Anderson, Michael Smith, Michael van Gerwen and Gerwyn Price will all be vying to hold aloft the famous Phil Taylor Trophy in what should be a mouth-watering nine days of action. Turner chews over her favourite first-round matches and who she thinks will walk away with the title. But we start with the Women's World Matchplay where Turner will be among several other female players battling it out at the inaugural staging of the £25,000 event with the winner set to walk away with a cool £10,000. (1) Lisa Ashton vs (8) Chloe O'Brien(4) Aileen de Graaf vs (5) Laura Turner(2) Fallon Sherrock vs (7) Katie Sheldon(3) Lorraine Winstanley vs (6) Rhian Griffiths My practising has been going really well at home and also trying to get in as much match practice as I possibly can as well. I'm just trying not to overthink it. I know when I've gone into these bigger televised tournaments I tend to let it worry me and kind of nag me a little bit so I'm just trying to stay relaxed, stay confident, just keep on the oche and hopefully everything will work out when we get to that massive stage at the Winter Gardens. Nervous but really, really excited and looking forward to it. This Women's Matchplay is a huge opportunity, not just to showcase what we can do at the moment, but also to inspire that next generation, for them to see us up there and think 'I can do that' and 'I want to do that' to pick up a set of darts and try the sport. If you don't see people doing it then you don't have your heroes, you don't have your inspiration, you don't have that goal to inspire to. You can perhaps look at women's football at the moment, you've got sell-out stadiums now and five, 10 years ago that would have been unheard of. So to have Sky Sports show the Women's Matchplay, to have the support of the PDC, to have the increased Women's Series, the places in the Grand Slam of Darts, the World Championship, and now this Women's Matchplay, it's just an unbelievable opportunity and I hope we can all do it proud. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It holds a very special place in the heart of fans and players alike, not just because you're playing in one of the most beautiful buildings in the world but it's one of those no-nonsense tournaments. It's a straight-leg knockout. You have to come out of those blocks straight away or you will be found out. There is no set-play and there is no time to regroup. It really is just a race to the end and that lends itself to a bit of drama and hopefully we'll see much more of it this year. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That match between Michael van Gerwen and Adrian Lewis looks set to be an absolute cracker. They last met at The Matchplay back in 2016 believe it or not and they haven't really played a lot against each other over the last couple of years. Their rivalry expands to over 60 competitive matches against each other and down the years they've produced fireworks, drama, and more importantly, they produce the most entertaining matches. I'm hoping for more of the same. Lewis is coming into the game off the back of a win at Players Championship 20 and he's really found his form. We've only seen Van Gerwen play once since winning the Premier League, but hopefully if both these players can find their form and get started quick, then we should be in for an absolute belter. Joe Cullen vs Damon HetaJames Wade vs Martin LukemanMichael van Gerwen vs Adrian LewisLuke Humphries vs Nathan Aspinall You've got the reigning Masters champion and Premier League runner-up, Joe Cullen, taking on the recently crowned World Cup of Darts champion, Damon Heta. Heta finished highest on the ProTour Order of Merit to claim his place. You've also got Luke Humphries, who's top of the European tour table, taking on Nathan Aspinall. I wouldn't say Luke was particularly a dark horse because he is winning titles at the moment, but if he hits the floor running I think he could go deep in this competition. There are several players in there who wouldn't surprise me if they won it. I'd say going into this you've got Michael Smith, Gerwyn Price, MVG, Luke Humphries all in really, really good form. But if I'm going to go on a limb, then Jonny Clayton just never fails to impress and I think although he dived out early last year I think I'll back him to win it this year."}}
